## The Builder Design Pattern 

The builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to encapsulate the construction of an object and allow it to be constructed in steps
In the context of Go programming this pattern help us construct complex objects without 
initializing their struct, or writing the logic they require. Imagine an object that could 
have dozens of fields that are more complex struct themselves. If you have many objects with 
these characteristics implementing the logic they require becomes cumbersome, so the builder pattern can help us tackle such cases. The Builder pattern is often used to build composite structures


The benefits of the builder pattern: 
    - It encapsulates the way a complex object is constructed 
    - It allows objects to be construccted in a multistep and varying process (as opposed to one-step factories). 
    - Hides the internal representation of the product from the client. 
    - Product implementations can be swapped in and out because the client only sees an abstract interface

The drawback: 
    - Constructing objects require more domain knowledge of the client.

Let's use vehicle manufacturing to demonstrate the use case of the Builder pattern. 
Since the manufacture of a vehicle has many steps, we can't just instantiate a vehicle 
objects and fill the many attributes it requires at instantiation. We'll create a 
vehicle builder. The process of creating a vehicle is more or less the same for every 
kind of vehicle - choose the vehicle type, assemble the structure, place the wheels, and place 
the seats. The ManufacturingDirector class represent the builder class responsible for building 
vehicle objects. the vehicle can be a Car as well as a Motorbike for our example. 

The requirements for a Vehicle builder are the following: 

    - A manufacturing type that constructs everything that a vehicle needs 
    - When using a car  builder , the VehicleProduct with four wheels, five seats and a structure defined as a Car must be returned 
    - When using a MotorBike builder, the VehicleProduct with two wheels, two seats and a structure defined as motorbike must be returned 
    - A VehicleProduct built by any BuildProcess builder must be open to modifications

```go 

package builder 


// The BuildProcess interface defines the steps that 
// are required to build a vehicle. Every builder must 
// implement this interface if they are to be used for 
// manufacturing
// On every set step, we return the same build process, so we 
// can chain various steps together in the same statement
type BuildProcess interface{
    SetWheels() BuildProcess 
    SetSeats() BuildProcess 
    SetStructure() BuildProcess 
    GetVehicle() VehicleProduct
}

// The manufacturing director variable is one in charge 
// of accepting the builders
// It has a Construct method that will use the builder 
// That is stored in Manufacturing, and will reproduce
// the Required steps. The
type ManufacturingDirector struct{

}

func (d *ManufacturingDirector) Construct(){
    // Logic goes here
}

func (d *ManufacturingDirector) SetBuilder(b BuildProcess){
    // Implementation...
}


type VehicleProduct struct{
    Wheels int 
    Seats int 
    Structure string 
}

// The Product is the final object that we want to retrieve
// while using the manufacturing
type CarBuilder struct{} 

func (c *CarBuilder) SetWheels() BuildProcess{
    return nil 
}

func (c *CarBuilder) SetSeats() BuildProcess{
    return nil 
}

func (c *CarBuilder) SetStructure() BuildProcess{
    return nil
}

func (c *CarBuilder) Build() VehicleProduct{
    return VehicleProduct()
}

``` 

The first builder is the car builder. It must implement every method defined in 
the build process interface. This is where the information for that particular 
builder will be set 

```go 

type BikeBuilder struct{} 

func (b *BikeBuilder) SetWheels() BuildProcess{
    return nil 
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) SetSeats() BuildProcess{
    return nil
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) SetStructure() BuildProcess{
    return nil 
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) Build() VehicleProduct(){
    return VehicleProduct{}
}

``` 

The MotorBike structure must be the same as the Car structure, as 
they are all Builder implementations, one have to keep in mind that their method of manufacture 
differ significantly. 

We will write failing tests for the requirements of our Builder struct. 

```go 

package builder

import "testing" 

func TestCarBuilder(t *testing.T){
    manufacturingDirector := ManufacturingDirector{} 

    carBuilder := &CarBuilder{} 
    manufacturingDirector.SetBuilder(carBuilder) 
    manufacturingDirector.Construct()

    car := carBuilder.Build()

    if car.Wheels != 4{
        t.Errorf("Wheels on a car must be 4 and was %d\n", car.Wheels)
    }

    if car.Structure != "Car"{
        t.Errorf("Structure on a car must be 'Car' and was %s\n", car.Structure)
    }

    if car.Seats != 5{
        t.Errorf("Seats on a Car must be 5 and was %d\n", car.Seats)
    }

}

func TestMotorBikeBuilder(t *testing.T){
    manufacturingDirector := &ManufacturingDirector{} 

    motorbikeBuilder := &BikeBuilder{} 

    manufacturingDirector.SetBuilder(motorbikeBuilder)
    manufacturingDirector.Construct() 

    motorbike := motorbikeBuilder.GetVehicle() 
    motorbike.Seats = 1 

    if motorbike.Wheels != 2{
        t.Errorf("Wheels on MotorBike must be 2 but got %d\n", motorbike.Wheels)
    }

    if motorbike.Structure != "MotorBike"{
        t.Errorf("Structure on MotorBile must be MotorBike but got %s\n", motorbike.Structure)
    }

}
```

If you run these tests they will all fail as we haven't written the full implementation yet. 
We wil start by implementing the ManufacturingDirector. it must accept a builder and construct 
a vehicle using the provided builder. 

```go 

package builder 

type ManufacturingDirector struct{
    builder BuildProcess
}

func (d *ManufacturingDirector) SetBuilder(b BuildProcess){
    d.builder = b 
}

func (d *ManufacturingDirector) Construct(){
    d.builder.SetSeats().SetStructure().SetWheels()
}

We implement our first builder, the Car builder in the following code snippet
A builder will need to store a VehicleProduct object,


type CarBuilder struct{
    v VehicleProduct
}

func (c *CarBuilder) SetWheels() BuildProcess{
    c.v.Wheels = 4 
    return c
}

func (c *CarBuilder) SetSeats() BuildProcess{
    c.v.Seats = 5 
    return c 
}

func (c *CarBuilder) SetStructure() BuildProcess{
    c.v.Structure = "Car" 
    return c
}

func (c *CarBuilder) GetVehicle() VehicleProduct{
    return c.v 
}

```

Let's implement our second builder the MotorBikeBUilder in the following snippet 
like the CarBuilder object the MotorBike builder will have to store an object 
of type VehicleProdut 

```go 

type MotorBikBuilder struct{
    v VehicleProduct
}


func (b *BikeBuilder) SetWheels() BuildProcess{
    b.v.Whees = 2 
    return b 
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) SetSeats() BuildProcess{
    b.v.Seats = 2 
    return b 
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) SetStructure() BuildProcess{
    b.v.Structure = "Motorbike"
    return b 
}

func (b *BikeBuilder) GetVehicle() VehicleProduct{
    return b.v 
}

```

Now if you run the previous tests we wrote above they should all pass! 

In summary the Builder design pattern help us maintain an unpredictable number of 
objects by using a common construction algorithm that is implemented by the builder 
class. The construction process is always abstracted from the user of the product.
The builder pattern should be avoided when we are unsure about the stability of the 
object construction algorithm overtime because any small change in the interface 
can affect the builders in sometimes backward incompatible ways.
