# Structural design patterns 

Structural design patterns are used to organize and strucure code 
in a way that is more modular, flexible and maintainable. These patterns 
help to simplify complex systems and improve the overall architecture of 
an application. In this article we'll explore some of the most common structural 
design patterns and provide examples of how they can be used in Go to create 
more efficient and scalable software.

## Proxy Pattern 

The Proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder placeholder for another 
object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you need to add additional 
functionality to an object whithout modifying its code. 

In Go, the Proxy Pattern can be used to add additional security and authentication 
checks to API requests. Here's an example implmentation. 

```go 

type API interface{
    Call() (string, error)
}

type ConcreteAPI struct{} 

func (c *ConcreteAPI) Call() (string, error){
    // code to make an API call
}

type APIProxy struct{
    api     API 
    authClient *AuthClient 
}

func (p *APIProxy) Call() (string, error){
    if p.authClient.IsAuthorized(){
        return p.api.Call() 
    }
    return "", errors.New("not authorized")
}

``` 

In this example, the APIProxy wraps the API interface and adds additional 
security checks before allowing API requests to be processed. 
This provides an additional layer of security withouth modifying the underlying 
API code. 

## Decorator Pattern 

The Decorator pattern is used to add additional functionality to an object at 
runtime without modifying its code. This pattern is usefull when you need to 
add new features to an existing object without breaking existing code. 

In Go, the Decorator pattern can be used to add new functionality to an 
existing struct without modifying its code. Here's an example implementation 

```go 

type Component interface{
    Operation() string 
}

type ConcreteComponent struct{

}

func (c *ConcreteComponent) Operation() string{
    return "ConcreteComponent"
}

type Decorator struct{
    component Component
}

func (d *Decorator) Operation() string{
    return d.component.Operation() + " + Decorator"
}

``` 
In this example, the decorator wraps the Component 
interface and adds additional functionality to the Operation 
method. This provides a way to add features to an 
existing struct withouth modifying its code. 

## Composite Pattern 

The composite pattern is used to treat a group of objects as 
a single object. This pattern is useful when you need to 
handle a group of objects in the same way you handle 
a single object. 

In Go, the Composite pattern can be used to treat a group 
of objects as a single object. Here's an example 

```go 

type Component interface{
    Do() string 
}

type Leaf struct{}

func (l *Leaf) Do() string{
    Children []Component 
}

func (c *Component) Add(component Component){
    c.Children = append(c.Children, component)
}

func (c *Composite) Do() string{
    var result []string 
    for _, child := range c.Children{
        result = append(result, child.Do())
    }
    return strings.Join(result, " + ")
}

``` 

In this example, the Composite treats a group of objects 
(either Leaf or Composite) as a single object. This provides 
a way to handle a group of object in the same way you 
handle a single object. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, Structural Design Patterns are essential for 
creating modular and maintainable software. Whether you're 
working on a small project or a large-scale application, 
understanding these patterns can help you improve the overall 
quality and structure of your code. These examples in Go 
demonstrate how these patterns can be applied in real-world 
scenarios. By incorporating structural design patterns into your 
development process, you can create more efficient, flexible and 
maintainable software.
