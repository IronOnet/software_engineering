## My thoughts on the threats posed by the Emergence of an Artificial General Inteligence Agent 

The current endeavors to build an artificial general intelligence that are taking place in various labs 
accross the globe will not necessarly result in the creation of an entity that might escape our control.
Contrary to biological intelligence, an artificial intelligence will not be the product of millions of years
of evolution and thus will not necessarily display the same survival reflexes that biological agents do. 
human quest for power and domination is one of the many expressions of survival mechanisms that nature has 
imparted us through evolution. 
At the core of modern artificial intelligence lies matrix algebra and statistics, 
modern artificial intelligence systems are just prediction machine, they are very good at predicting what comes next given
past events.

the current state of the art models are not sentient, we are far away from having an understanding of what sentience entails, cats and dogs are sentient although not as intelligent as humans. 
A system that can display the same level of sentience as a mamam
