# Requirements Gathering

    - Engage with stakeholders, including end-users,
    business analysts, and domain experts, to understand
    the needs and objectives of the software

    - Collect and document functional and non-functional
    requirements, capturing the desired features, constraints
    and performance expectations of the system.


# Analysis and Design

    - Analyze the gathered requirements to identify key system
    components, interactions, and dependencies

    - Create high-level system architecture and design, considering
    factors such as scalability, security, performance, and usability

    - Define the major modules or components of the system and their
    responsibilities

    - Identify interfaces, data flows, and integration points between
    modules.


# Prototyping:

    - Develop a proof of concept or a prototype to validate
    the feasability of the proposed architecture and design

    - Use the prototype to gather feedback from stakeholders and
    make necessary adjustments or refinements to the architecture.


# Detailed Design:

    - Translate the high-level architecture into more detailed design
    specificatoins for each component or module.

    - Define the data structures, algorithms, and APIs required for each
    module.

    - Consider design patterns, best practices, and coding standards while
    designing the system.


# Development

    - Implement the software based on the detailed design specifications
    - Follow an iterative development approach, dividing the work into
    smaller tasks or user stories and delivering incremental functionality

    - Conduct regular code reviews, testing, and debuggin to ensure the
    quality and correctness of the implementation.


# Integration and Testing:

    - Integrate the developed modules and components to create a cohesive
    system

    - Conduct integration testing to verify the interactions between
    different modules and identify and resolve integration issues or
    inconsistencies.

    - Perform system testing to validate the overall functionality
    performance, and behavior of the software


# Deployment

    - Prepare the software for deployment in the target environment
    - Set up the necessary infrastructure including servers,
    databases, and networking configs
    - Package and deploy the software, ensuring proper installation and
    configuration


# Monitoring and Iteration:

    - Monitor the deployed software in the production environment
    to identify any performance issues, bugs or usability problems

    - Gather user feedback and incorporate necessary improvements
    or bug fixes through iterative development Lifecycle

# Maintainance and support
