# Burning Ether

As well as creating ether through block rewards, ether can be destroyed through
a process called burning. When ethere gets burned, it gets removed from circulation
permanently.

Ether burn occurs in every transaction on Ethereum. When users pay for their
transactions, a base gas fee, set by the network according to transactional
demand, gets destroyed. This coupled with variable block sizes and a maximum
gas fee, simplifies transaction fee estimation on Ethereum. When network demand
is high, blocks can burn more ethere than they mint, effectively offseting ether
issuance.

Burning the base fee hinders a block producers ability to manipulate transactions.
For example, if block producers received the base fee, they could include their own
transactons for free and raise the base fee for everyone else.

## Ether Denominations

Wei ==> 10^-18 Eth
Gwei ==> 10^-9 Eth

## Transfering Ether

Each transaction on Ethereum contains a value field, which specifies the amount
of ether to be transfered, denominated in wei, to send from the sender's address
to the recipient address.

When the recipient address is a smart contract, this transferred ether may be
used to pay for gas when the smart contract executes its code.

## Querying Ether

Users can query the ether balance of any ccount by inspecting the account's balance
field, which shows ether holdings denominated in wei.

Etherscan is a popular tool to inspect address balances via a web-based app.
