# Introduction To DAPPs

A decentralized application (dapp) is an application built on a decentralized
network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface.
On Ethereum, smart contracts are accessible and transparent.

## Definitioan

A dapp has its backend code running on a decentralied peer-to-peer network.
Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any languages (lust like
an app) to make calls to its backend. Furtheremore, its frontend can get hosted on
decentralized storage such as IPFS

- Decentralied: dapps operate on Ethereum, an open decentralied platform where
no one person or group has control

- Deterministic: dapps perform the same function irrespective of the environment
in which they get executed

- Turinng complete: dapps can perform any acton given the required resources

- Isolated: dapps are executed in a virtual environment known as an EVM.
