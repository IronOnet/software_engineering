# Golang DDD & Clean Architecture Project structure:

Let's consider a web application for a hotel booking system. In this example, we can identify two distinct bounded contexts: the Booking Management Context and the User Authentication Context.

1. **Booking Management Context**:
   - Use Case: Create a new booking
     - User can select the desired dates, room type, and number of guests.
     - The system checks for room availability and calculates the total cost.
     - User provides personal information and payment details.
     - The system confirms the booking and sends a confirmation email.
   - Use Case: Cancel a booking
     - User provides the booking ID or email used during booking.
     - The system verifies the booking and cancels it.
     - The system sends a cancellation confirmation email.

2. **User Authentication Context**:
   - Use Case: User Registration
     - User provides their name, email, and password.
     - The system validates the input and creates a new user account.
     - The system sends a verification email to the user.
   - Use Case: User Login
     - User provides their email and password.
     - The system verifies the credentials and grants access.
     - The system generates an authentication token for subsequent requests.
   - Use Case: User Profile Update
     - User can update their personal information, such as name and contact details.
     - The system validates the changes and updates the user profile.

In this example, the Booking Management Context focuses on managing the hotel bookings, while the User Authentication Context handles user registration, login, and profile management.

To implement these bounded contexts, you can follow the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture in your Go codebase:

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - Define domain models such as `Booking` and `User` with their respective attributes and behaviors.
   - Implement domain services like `BookingService` and `UserService` to encapsulate the business logic related to bookings and user management.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Implement use cases as application services, such as `BookingService` and `UserService`, which orchestrate the domain models and handle the business logic for creating bookings, canceling bookings, user registration, login, and profile updates.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Implement repositories to persist and retrieve data related to bookings and user information.
   - Implement external services for sending emails, validating payments, and authentication.

4. **Interfaces**:
   - Implement web handlers or controllers to handle HTTP requests and interact with the application services.
   - Define interfaces for external services, such as email providers and payment gateways, to decouple the application from specific implementations.

By following these principles, you can achieve a modular and maintainable codebase that separates the concerns of different bounded contexts and allows for independent development and testing.
