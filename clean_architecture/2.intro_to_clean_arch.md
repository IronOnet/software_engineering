# The Problem With Layers

- It promotes database-driven design
- It's prone to shortcuts
- It grows hard to test
- It hides the Use cases
- It makes Parallel work Difficult


## The Dependency Inversion Principle

Inverting the direction of any dependency within our codebase
Let's try to invert the dependency between our domain and persistance
code so that the persistance code depends on the domain code, reducing
the number of reasons to change for the domain code.

==> We have a service in the domain layer that works with entities and repositories
from the persistance layer.

First of all, we want to pull up the entities into the domain layer because they
represent our domain objects and our domain code pretty much revolves around
changing state in those entities.

==> Cfr book: By introducing an interface in the domain layer, we can invert the
dependency so that the persistance layer depends on the domain layer.

## Clean Architecture

In a clean architecture, the business rules are testable by design and independent
of frameworks, databases, UI technologies and other external applications or interfaces.

That means that the domain code must not have any outward facing dependencies. Instead
with the help of the Dependency Inversion Principle, all dependencies point toward
the domain code.
