## Understanding the Cascade 

=> User agent styles are the default browser styles
After user agents styles are considerecd the browser applies your styles. the author's style.

``html 

<html>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>Wombat Coffee Roasters</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Home</li>
                <li>Coffees</li>
                <li>Brewers</li>
                <li>Specials</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

```

```css 

h1{
    color: #2f4f4f; 
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

#main-nav{
    margin-top: 10px; 
    list-style: none; 
    padding-left: 0;
}

#main-nav li{
    display: inline-block;
}

#main-nav a{
    color: white; 
    background-color: #13a4a4; 
    padding: 5px; 
    border-radius: 2px; 
    text-decoration: none;
}

```

* Important Declarations 

There's an exception to the style origin rules: declarations that are marked as important 
. A declaration can be marked important by adding !important to the end of the declaration

color: red !important; 

Declaration market !important are treated as a higher-priority origin, so the overall order
of preference, in decreasing order is this: 
    - Author important 
    - Author 
    - User agent


* Specificity 

Different types of selectors ave different specificities. An ID selector has a higher 
specificity than a class selector,
    - If a selector has more IDs, it wins (that is more specific) 
    - If that results in a tie, the selector with the most classes wins. 
    - If that results in a tile, the selector with the most tag names wins

```csss 

html body header h1{
    color: blue;
}

body header.page-header h1{
    color: orange;
}

.page-header .title{
    color: green;
}

#page-title{
    color: red;
}

* Using the "initial" keyword 

Sometimes you'll find you have styles applied to an element that you want to undo. 
You can do this by specifying the keyword initial. Every CSS property has an initial 
or default value. If you assign the value initial to that property, then it effectively 
resets to its default value. It's like a hard-reset of that value.

```css 

.footer a{
    color: initial; // black
    text-decoration: underline
}


``` 

## Shorthand properties 

These are properties that let you set the values of several other properties at one time. 
For example, font is a shorthand property that lets you set several font properties 

font: italic bold 18px/1.2 "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;

Similarly: 
- background is a shorthand property for multiple background properties: 
- background-color, background-image, background-size, background-repeat, background-position, background-origin, background-chip, and background-attachment. 

- border is a shortahdn for border-width, border-style and border-color, which are in turn shorthand properties as well 
- border-width is shorthand for the top, right, bottom, and left border widths
