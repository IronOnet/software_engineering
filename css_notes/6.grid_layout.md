# Grid layout 

## Intro 

The css grid lets you define a two-dimensional layout of columns and rows then place elements within the grid. Some elements may only fill one cell of the grid; other can span multiple columns or rows. The size of the grid can be defined precisely, or you can allow it to automatically size itself as needed to fit the content within. 

### BUilding a basic grid 

### Anatomy of a grid 

Grid containers and grid items are the elements that make up a grid. 

- Grid line : these make up the structure of the grid. A grid line can be vertical or horizontal and line on either side of a row or column. 

- Grid track: A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines. A grid has horizontal tracs (rows) and vertical tracks (columns) 

- Grid cell, A single space on the grid, where a horizontal grid track and a vertical grid track overlap. 

- Grid area: A rectangular area on the grid made up by one or more grid cells. the area is between two vertical grid lines and two horizontal grid lines. 


### Side note 

sometimes you won't want to set a fixed size on a grid track, but you'll want to constrain it within certain minimum and maximum values. This is where the minmax() function comes in. 
it specifies two values, a minimum and 
a maximum size. The browser will ensure
the grid track falls between these values.
