# 3. Working With Docker images

Every docker container is based on an image, which provides the basis for everything
that you will ever deploy and run with Docker. To launch a container, you must
either download a public image or create your own.

## Anatomy of a Dockerfile

To create a custom Docker image with the default tools, you will need
to become familiar with the Dockerfile. This file describes all the steps
that  are required to create one image.

```docker
