# Docker Networking

The techniques used for networking containers are very similar to the techniques used
to network virtual machines. Containers on a host can be attached to a software switch
and iptables are used to control network traffic between containers and expose processes
running in the container on ports of the host.


=> At installation time, the docker engine sets up multiple default networking behaviors
on your hosts, which gives you a fully working setup from the start.
