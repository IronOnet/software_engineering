# How to implement DDD with GO 

## Entities and value objects 

An entity is a struct that has an identifier and that can change state, by chaning 
state we mean that the values of the entity can change. 

There can be occurences where we have structs that are immutable and do ont 
need a unique identifier, these structs are called value objects. So structs without 
an identifier and persistent values after creation. Value objects are often found 
inside domains and used to describe certain aspects in that domain. 

## Aggregates - combined value objects and entities 

An aggregate is a set of entities and value objects combined. So in our case, we can 
begin by creating a new aggregate which is the Customer. 

The reason for an aggregate is that the business logic wil be applied on the 
Customer aggregate, instead of each Entity holding the logic. An aggreage does 
not allow direct access to underlying entities. It is also common that multiple 
entities are needed to correctly represent data in real life. for instance a 
Customer.

# Factories - Encapsulate complex logic 

The factory pattern is a design pattern that is used to encapsulate 
complex logic in functions that creates the wanted instance, without 
the caller knowing anything about the implementation details. 

Factory pattern is a very common pattern, you can use it even outside DDD 
application, and you probably already have used it many times. A great 
example is the official Go elastic search client. You insert a configuration 
into a NewClient function, which is a factory, that returns a client that 
is connected to an elastic cluster and you can insert/remove documents. 


```go 

func NewClient(cfg Config) (*Client, error){
    var addr[] string 

    if len(cfg.Adresses) == 0 && cfg.CloudID == ""{
        addrs = addrsFromEnvironment()
    } else{
        if len(cfg.Adresses)  > 0 && cfg.CloudID != ""{
            return nil, errors.New("cannot create client: both addresses and config are invalid")
        }

        if cfg.CloudID != ""{
            cloudAddr, err := addrFromCloudID(cfg.CloudID) 
            if err != nil{
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot create client: cannot parse CloudID") 
            }

            addrs = append(addrs, cloudAddr)
        }

        if len(cfg.Addresses) > 0{
            addrs = append(addrs, cfg.Addresses...)
        }
    }

    urls, err := addrsToURLs(addrs) 
    if err != nil{
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot create client: %s", err) 
    }

    if len(urls) == 0{
        u, _ := url.Parse(defaultURL) 
        urls = append(urls, u) 
    }

    if urls[0].User != nil{
        cfg.Username = ursl[0].User.Username() 
        pw, _ := urls[0].User.Password() 
        cfg.Password = pw 
    }


    tp, err := estransport.New(estransport.Config{
        URLs: urls, 
        Username: cfg.Username, 
        Password: cfg.Password, 
        APIKey: cfg.APIKey, 
        ServiceToken: cfg.ServiceToken, 

        Header: cfg.Header, 
        CACert: cfg.CACert,

        ...
    })

    if err != nil{
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("error creating transport: %s", error)
    }

    client := &Client{Transport: tp} 
    client.API = esapi.New(client) 

    if cfg.DiscoverNodesOnStart{
        go client.DiscoverNodes()
    }

    return client, nil 
}

```


DDD suggests using factories for creating complex aggregates, repositories, and 
services. W
