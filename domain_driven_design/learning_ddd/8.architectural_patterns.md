# Architectural Patterns

 ==> The layered architecture decomposes the codebase based on its technological
concerns. Since this pattern decouples business logic with data access implementation,
it's a good fit for active record-based systems.

==> The ports & adapters architecture inverts the relationship: it puts the
business logic at the center and decouples it from all infrastructural dependencies.
This pattern is a good fit for business logic implemented with the domain model pattern.

==> The CQRS pattern represents the same data in multiple models. Although this
pattern is obligatory for systems based on the event-sourced domain model, it
can also be used in any systems that need a way of working with multiple persistent
models.
