## Communication Patterns

### Communication Modes

==> Synchronous
==> asynchronous

Patterns for integrating a system's components.

==> Outbox pattern: a reliable way to publish aggregate's domain events.
It ensures that domain events are always going to be published.

==> The Saga pattern can be used to implement simple cross-component
business processes. More complex business processes can be implemented using
the process manager pattern. Both patterns rely on asynchronous reactions to
domain events and the issuing of commands.
