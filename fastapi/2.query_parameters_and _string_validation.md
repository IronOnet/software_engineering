## Query Parameters and String Validation 

FAPI allows you to declare additional information and validation for your parameters 

```python 

from typing import Union 

from fastapi import FastAPI 

app = FastAPI() 

@app.get("/items/") 
async def read_items(q: Union[str, None]=None): 
	results = {"items: [{"item_id": "Foo"}, {"item_id": "Bar"}]) 
	if q: 
		results["q"] = q 
	return results 
``` 

The query paraemter q is of type Union[str, None] or (str | None in python 3.10), that means that 
it's of type str but could also be None, and indeed the default value is None, 


### Additinal Validation 

We are going to enforce that even though q is optional, whenever it is provided, its length doesn't 
exceed 50 characters. 

```py 


from typing import Union 

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from typing_extensions import Annotated 

app = FastAPI() 

@app.get("/items/") 
async def read_items(q: Annotated[Union[str, None], Query(max_length=50)]= None): 
	results = {"items": [{"item_id": "Foo"}, {"item_id": "Bar"}]} 
	if q: 
		results.update({"q": q}) 
	return results 

```

## Use Annotated in the type for the q parameter 

When you need to declare a value as required while using Query, you can simply not declare a default value.
