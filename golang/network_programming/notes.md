## Architecture 

The eight fallacies of distributed computing 

    - The network is reliable 
    - Latency is zero 
    - Bandwidth is infinite 
    - The network is secure 
    - Topology doesn't change 
    - There is one administrator 
    - Transport cost is zero 
    - The network is homogenous


* The chinese gvt uses "DNS Poisoning" as one of its techniques to censor what it considers to be undesirable websites

* Latency is the delay between sending a signal and getting a reply. In a single process system, latency can depend on the amount of computation performed in a function call before it can return, but on the network it usually caused by simply having to traverse transports and be processed by all sorts of nodes such as routers on the way.

* The Latency of the Linux scheduler has a mean value of 88 microseconds
