# Packages

## The Go Tool

The go tool combines the features of a diverse set of tools into one command set.
It is a package manager (analogous to apt or rpm) that answers queries about
its inventory of packages, computes their dependencies and downloads them from
remote version-control systems.

go
    - build: compile packages and dependencies
    - clean: remove object files
    - doc: show documentation for package or symbol
    - env print Go environment information
    - fmt: run gofmt on package source
    - get : download and install packages and dependencies
    - list list packages
    - run compile and run Go program
    - test test packages
    - version print Go version
    - vet run go tool vet on packages


## Internal Packages

The package is the most important mechanism for encapsulation in Go programs.
Unexported identifiers are visible only within the same package, and exported identifiers
are visible to the world.

In Go ther is a way to define identiiers that are visible to a small set of
trusted packages, but not to everyone.  
The go build tool treats a package specially if its import path contains a path
segment named internal. such packages are called internal packages.

==> An internal package my be imported only by another package that is inside the tree
rooted at the parent of the internal directory.
