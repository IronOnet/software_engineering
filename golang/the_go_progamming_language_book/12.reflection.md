# Reflection

Go provides a mechanism to updte variables and inspect their values at run time, to call their
methods, and to apply

## Why Reflection

Sometimes we need to write a function capable of dealing uniformly with values of types that
don't satisfy a common interface, don't exist at the time we design the function or even
all three.

A familiar example is the formatting logic within the fmt.Fprintf, which  

```go

func Sprint(x interface{}) string{
  type stringer interface{
    String() string
  }

  switch x := x.(type){
  case stringer:
    return x.String()
  case string:
    return x
  case int:
    return strconv.Itoa(x)
  case bool:
    if x{
      return "true"
    }
    return false
  default:
    return "???"
  }
}
```

## reflect.Type and reflect.Value

Reflection is provided by the reflect package. It defines two important types,
Type and Value. a Type represent a Go type. It is an interface with many maehtods
for discriminating among types and inspecting their components, like the field


The reflect.Typeof function accepts any interface{} and returns its dynamic type as a
reflect.Type:
