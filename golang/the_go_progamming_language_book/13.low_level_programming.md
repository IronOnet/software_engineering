# Low Level Programming

The design of Go guarantees a number of safety properties that limit the ways
in which a Go program can "go wrong". During compilation, type checking
detects most attempts to apply an operation to a value that is Inapropriate for
its type, for instance, subracting one string from another.

For errors, that cannot be detected statically, such as out-of-bounds array accesses or nil pointer
dereferences, dynamic checks ensure that the program immediately terminates with an
informative error whenever a forbidden operation occrus.  

Automatic memory management (garbage collection) eliminates "use after free" bugs, as
well as most memory leaks.
