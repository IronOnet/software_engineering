# Composite Data types

In Go the composite data types are the molecules created by combining the basic
data types in various ways. Arrays, slices, maps and structs

## Arrays

An array is a fixed-length sequence of zeros or more elements of a particular types
Because of their fixed length, arrays are rarely used in Go


```go

var a [3]int // an array of length 3
fmt.Println(a[0]) // print the first elemnt
fmt.Println(a[len(a)-1]) // Print the last element

```

By default the elements of a new array variable are initially set to zero value
for the element type which is 0 for numbers. We can use an array literal to initialize
an array with a list of values  

```go

var q[3] int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}  
var r[3] int = [3]int{1, 2}

```

In an array literal, if an ellipis "..." appears in place of the length, the array
length is determined by the number of initializers. The definition of q can be simplified
to  

```go

q := [...]int{1, 2, 3}  
fmt.Println("%T\n", q) // [3]int

q := [3]int{1, 2, 3}  
q := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4} // Compile error: cannot assign [4]int


type Currency int

const (
  USD Currency = iota
  EUR
  GBP
  CDF
  RMB
  JPY
)

symbol := [...]string{USD: "$", EUR: "â‚¬", CDF: "Fc" }
fmt.Println(CDF, symbol[CDF])
