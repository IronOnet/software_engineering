# Interface

An interface is an abstract type. It doesn't expose the internal structure  
of its values.

```go

package fmt

// The String method is used to print values passed
// as an operand to any format that accepts a string
// or to an unformatted printer such as print
type Stringer interface{
  String()
}
```

## Interface Types

An interface type specifies a set of methods that a concrete type must posess
to be considered an instance of that interface.

The io.Writer interface is the most used interface type because it provides
an abstraction of all types to which bytes can be written, which includes files
memory buffers, network connections, HTTP clients, archivers, hashers and so on.

```go

package io

type Reader interface{
  Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Closer interface{
  Close() error
}

// Looking further, we find declarations of new interface types as combinations
// of existing ones  

type ReaderWriter interface{
  Reader
  Writer
}

type ReadWriterCloser interface{
  Reader
  Writer
  Closer
}

// The syntax used above, which resembles struct embedding lets us name another
// interface as a shorthand for writing out all its methods. This is called
// embedding an interface. We could have written io.ReadWriter without embedding
// albeit less succintly like this.

type ReadWriter interface{
  Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
  Writer
}

// All three implementation have the same effect the order in which methods
// appear is immterial

```

## Interface Satisfaction

A type satisfies an interface if it posseses all the methods the interface requires
for example an *os.File satisfies io.Reader, Writer, Closer, and ReadWriter.
A *bytes.Buffer statisfies Reader, Writer and ReadWriter

```go

var w io.Writer  
w = os.Stdout // OK: *os.File has a write method
w = new(bytes.Buffer) // OK: *bytes.Buffer has a write method
w = time.Second

```

## Interface Values

Conceptually, a value of an interface type, or an interface value has two components
a concrete type and a value of that type. These are called the interface's dynamic type
and dynamic value.  


## Type assertions

A type assertion is an operation applied to an interface value. Syntatically it looks
like x.(T), where x is an expression of an interface type and T is a type, called the
asserted type. A type assertion checks that the dynamic type of its operand matches
the asserted type.

```go

var w io.Writer
w = os.Stdout
f := w.(*os.File) // success = f == os.Stdout
c := w.(*bytes.Buffer) // panic: interface holds *os.File, not *bytes.BufferÂ²
```

### Discriminating errors with type assertions

os package provides these three helpers functions to classify the failure
indicated by a given error value:

```go

package os

func IsExist(err error) bool
func IsNotExist(err error) bool
func IsPermission(err error) bool

// A naive implementation of the previous predicates might check that the
// error message contains a certain string

func IsNotExist(err error) bool{
  return strings.Contains(err.Error(), "file does not exist")
}


```

but because of the logic for handling I/O errors can vary from one platform to
another, this approach is not robust and the same failure may be reported with
a variety of different error messages.

A more reliable approach is to represent structured error values using a dedicated
type. The os package defines a type called PathError to describe failure involving
an operation on file path, like Open or Delete, and a variant called LinkError
to describe failures of operations involving two file paths, like Symlink and
Rename.

```go

package os

type PathError struct{
  Op string
  Path string
  Err error
}

func (e *PathError) Error() string{
  return e.Op + " " + " " + e.Path + ": "  + e.Err.Error()
}

```

```go

import (
  "errors"
  "syscall"
)

var ErrNotExist = errors.New("file does not exist")

// IsNotExist returns a boolean indicating whether the error is known
// to report that a file or directory does not exist. It is satified by
// ErrNotExist as well as some syscall errors.
func IsNotExist(err error) bool{
  if pe, ok := err.(*PathError); ok{
    err = pe.Err
  }
  return err == syscall.ENOENT || err == ErrNotExist
}

```


## Querying Behaviors with interface type assertiosn

```go

func writeHeader(w io.Writer, contentType stirng) error{
  if _, err := w.Write([]byte("content-type: ")); err != nil{
    return err
  }

  if _, err := w.Write([]byte("contentType")); err != nil{
    return err
  }
}

```

## Type switches

Interfaces are used in two distinct styles, In the first style, exemplified by
io.Reader, io.Writer, fmt.Stringer, sort.Interface, http.Handler and error
an interface's methods express the similarities of the concrete types that
satify the interface but hide the representation details and instrinsic operations
of those concrete types. The emphasis is on the methods, not the concrete types.

- The second style exploits the ability of an interface value to hold values of
a variety of concrete types and considers the interface to be the union of those
types. Type assertions are used to discriminate among these types dynamically
and treat each case differently


In object oriented programming these two styles are also known as  
subtype polymorphism and ad-hoc polymorphism, but you need'nt remember those
terms.

```go

import "database/sql"

func listTracks(db sql.DB, artist string, minYear, maxYear int){
  result, err := db.Exect(
    "SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE artist = ? AND ? <= year AND year <= ?",
    artist, minYear, maxYear
  )
}

```

The Exec method replaces each '?' in the query string with an SQL literal denoting
the corresponding argument value, which may be a boolean, a number, a string, or nil

```go

func sqlQuote(x interface{}) string{
  if x == nil{
    return "NULL"
  } else if _, ok := x.(int); ok{
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d", x)
  } else if _, ok := x.(uint); ok{
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d", x)
  } else if b , ok := x.(bool); ok{
    if b{
      return "TRUE"
    }
    return "FALSE"
  } else if s, ok := x.(string); ok{
    return sqlQuoteString(s) //
  } else{
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("unexpected type %T: %v", x, x))
  }
}

// A switch statment simplifies the if-elses
func sqlQuote(x interface{}) string{
  switch x := x.(type) {
  case nil:
    return "NULL"
  case int, uint:
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d", x)
  case bool:
    if x{
      return "TRUE"
    }
    return "FALSE"
  case string:
    return sqlQuoteString(x)
  default:
    panic fmt.Sprintf("unexpected type: %T: %v", x, x)
  }

}

```
