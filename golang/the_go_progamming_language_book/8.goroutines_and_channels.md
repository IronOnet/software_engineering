# Goroutines and Channels

In Go, each concurrently executing activity is called a goroutine. Consider a program
that has two functions

```go

func main(){
  go spinner(100 * time.Millisecond)
  const n = 45
  fibN := fib(n) // slow
  fmt.Printf("\rFibonnacci(%d) = %d\n", n, fibN)
}

func spinner(delay time.Duration){
  for{
    for _, r := range `-\|/`{
      fmt.Printf("\r%c", r)
      time.Sleep(delay)
    }
  }
}

func fib(x int) int{
  if x < 2{
    return x
  }
  return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
}

```
