# Concurrency with shared variables

## Race conditions

When we cannot confidently say that one event happens before the other, then events
x and y are said to be concurrent.

A function is concurrency safe if it continues to work correctly even when called
concurrently, that is from two or more goroutines with no additional synchronization.
We can generalize this notion with a set

A race condition is a situation in which the program does not give the correct result
for some interleaving of the multiple operations of multiple goroutines.


## Mutual Exclusion: sync.Mutex



## GOMAXPROCS

The go scheduler uses a parameter called GOMAXPROCS to determine how many
OS threads may be actively executing Go code simultaneously. It's default value
is the number of CPUs on the machine.

You can explicitely control this parameter using the GOMAXPROCS env variable
or the runtime.GOMAXPROCS funciton. we can see the effect of
