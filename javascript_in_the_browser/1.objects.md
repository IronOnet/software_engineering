## Javascript Objects

```javascript

const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio: function(){
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old`);
  },
  introduceSelf: function(){
    console.log(`Hi I'm ${this.name[0]}`);
  },
};

person.name;
person.name[0];
person.age;
person.bio();
// "Bob smith is 32 years old"
person.introduceSelf();

// An object property can itself be an object. For example, try changin
// the name member
const person = {
  name:{
    first: "Bob",
    last: "Smith",
  }
}

// We can use indexes to retrieve the value of a proprety
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
};

function logProperty(propertyName){
  console.log(person[propertyName]);
}

logProperty("name"); // ["Bob", "Smith"]
logProperty("age"); // 32

// Setting object members
// You can also set (update) the value of object members by declaring
// the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation), like this:

person.age = 42;
person["name"]["last"] = "Cratchit";

```

## Object Prototypes

Prototypes are the mechanism by which Javascript objects inherit features from
one another.

Every object in Javascript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype
The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype,
making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype
that has a null for its own prototype.

When you try to acces a property of anobject: if the property can't be found in
the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property
still can't be found, then the prototype's protytpe is searched, and so on until
either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached

### Setting a prototype

There are various ways of setting an object's prototype in Javascript

Using Object.create:
The Object.create() method creates a new object and allows you to specify an
object that will be used as the new object's prototype.
Here's an example

```js

const personPrototype = {
  greet(){
    console.log("Hello");
  },
};

const carl = Object.create(personPrototype);
carl.greet();

// Here we create an object personPrototype, which has a greet() method.
// We then use Object.create() to create a new object with personPrototype
// as its prototype. Now we can call greet() on the new object, and the
// prototype provides it implementation.

```

## Using A Constructor

In javascript, all functions have a property named prototype. When you call
a function as a constructor, this property is set as the prototype of the
newly constructed object (by c)

```js

const personPrototype = {
  greet(){
    console.log(`hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

function Person(name){
  this.name = name;
}

Object.assign(Person.prototype, personPrototype);

```

Properties that are defined direclty in the object, like name here are
called own properties, and you can check whether a property is an own
property using the static Object.hasOwn() method.

```js

const irma = new Person("Irma");
console.log(Object.hasOwn(irma, "name"));
console.log(Object.hasOwn(irma, "greet"));

```


### Classes and Instances

```js

class Person{

  name;

  constructor(name){
    this.name = name
  }

  greet(){
    return { `Hello my name is ${this.name}`}
  }
}

const giles = new Person("Giles");
giles.introduceSelf(); // Hi! I'm giles

```

#### Encapsulation

```javascript

class Student: extends Person
    properties
      year
    constructor
      Student(name, year)
    methods
      introduceSelf()
      canStudyArchery() { return this.year > 1}

```

### Omitting constructors

If you don't need to do any special initialization you can omit the constructor
and a default constructor will be generated for you.

```javascript

class Animal{
  sleep(){
    console.log("zzzzzz");
  }
}

const spot = new Animal();
spot.sleep();
```

### Inheritence

```javascript  

class Professor extends Person{
  teaches;

  constructor(name, teaches);
}

// Encapsulation
class Student extends Person{
  #year;

  constructor(name, year){
    this.year = year;
    this.name = name;
  }
}


```

## Working With JSON

Javascript Object Notation is a standard text-based format for
representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. it is
commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g sending some
data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page)

JSON exists as a string -- useful when you want to transmit ata accross a
network. It needs to be converted to a native Javascript object when you
want to access the data. This is not a big issue.

```

``js

async function populate(){
  const requestURL = "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";

  const request = new Request(requestURL);

  const response = await fetch(request);
  const superHeroes = await response.json();

  populateHeder(superHeroes);
  populateHeroes(superHeroes);
}

``

## Converting Between Objects and Text

A built-in JSON object is available in browsers, which contains the following
two methods:

- parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding
Javascript object.
- stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the corresponding
JavaScript object.


``javascript

async function populate(){
  const requestURL = "";
  const request = new Request(requestURL);

  const response = await fetch(request);
  const superHeroesText = await response.text();

  const superHeroes = JSON.parse(superHeroesText);
  populateHeader(superHeroes);
  populateHeroes(superHeroes);
}
