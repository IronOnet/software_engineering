# Manipulating Documents

When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things
you'll want to doe is manipulate the document structure in some
way. this is usually done using the DOM, a set of APIs for controlling
HTML and styling information that makes heavy use of the Document object

## The Important Part of a Web browser

==> The window: this is the browser tab that a web page is loaded into;
this is represented in Javascript by the window object. Using methods available
on this object you can do things like return the window's size
(window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight), manipulate the document loaded into
that window, store data specific to that document on the client side

==> The navigator: This represents the state and identity of the browser
the user agent as it exists on the web. In javascript, this is represneted
by the Navigator object. You can use this object to retrieve things like
the user's preferred language, a media stream from the user's webcam.

==> The document: represented by the DOM is the actual page loaded into the
window, and is represented in Javascript by the Document object. You can
use this object to return and manipulate information on the HTML and CSS
that comprises the document

## The Document Object Model

The document currently loaded in each one of your browser tabs is represented
by a document object model. This is a tree structure representation created
by the browser that enables the html structure to be easily accessed by programming languages

```html

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>Simple DOM Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <img src="dinausor.png" alt="a dino"/>
      <p>
        Here We will add a link to the mozilla  
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Homepage </a>
      </p>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

Each entry in the tree is called a node.
Nodes are also referred to by their posiiton in the three relative node

- Root Node: The top node in the tree, which in the case of HTML is always
the HTML node

- Child node: A node directly inside another node. For example IMG is a child
of section in the above example

- Descendant node: A node anywhere inside another node. For example

- A parent node: a node that has another node inside it.

- Sibling nodes: nodes that seet on the same level in the DOM tree
