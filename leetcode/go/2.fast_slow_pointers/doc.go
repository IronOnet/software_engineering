// The Fast & slow poniter approach, also knwon as the Hare & Tortoise 
// algorithm, is a pointer algorithms that uses two pointers which move 
// Through the array or the linked list at different speeds. This approach is 
// quite useful when dealing with cyclick LinkedList or arrays. 

// By moving at different speeds (say, in a Cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves 
// that the two ponters are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer 
// once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop. 

// one of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList.
