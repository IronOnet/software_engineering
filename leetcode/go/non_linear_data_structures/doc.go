// Non-linear data structures are used in cryptography and other areas. 
// A non linear-data structure is an arrangement in which an element 
// is connected to many elements. These structures 
// use memory quickly and efficiently. Free contiguous memory 
// is not requried for adding new elements 

// The length of the data structure is not important before adding 
// new elements. A non-linear data structure has multiple levels and 
// a linear one has a single level.

// The length of the data structure is not important before adding new 
// elements. A non-linear data structure has multiple levels and a linear 
// one has a single level. The valuesd of the elements 
// are not organized in a non-linear data structure
// This chapter covers the following non-linear data structures 
// - Trees 
// - Tables 
// - Containers 
// - Hash functions
