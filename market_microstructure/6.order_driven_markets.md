# Order-Driven Markets 

Order-driven markets use trading rules to arrange their trades. These markets 
include oral auctions, single price auctions, continious electronic auctions, 
and crossing networks. 

Almost all of the important exchanges in the world are order-driven markets. 
Most newly organized trading systems choose an electronic order-driven structure. 
All order-driven markets use order-precedence rules to match buyers to sellers
and trade pricing rules to price the resulting trades.  

Variations in trading rules distinguish order driven markets from each other. 
The trading strategies that work best in one market may work poorly in 
markets with different rules. Traders therefore need to know trading rules 
affect optimal trading strategies. 

## Rule-Based Order-Matching Systems 

Most exchanges, brokers, and all electronic communication use this scheme to 
arrange trades. Rule-based order matching systems use rules to arrange 
trades from the orders that traders submit to them. 

If the market is a call market, the market collects the orders before the call
Immediately following the call, its trading system makes one attempt to arrange 
trades. If the market is a continous trading market, its trading system attempts 
to arrange the trades. 

If the market is a continous market, the trading systems arrange trades as orders 
arrive. 

Every rule-based order-matching system uses the same sequence  of procedures when 
attempting to arrange trades. They first match orders using their order precedence 
rules. They then determine which matches can trade. 
Trades will occur if at least on buy order offers terms acceptable to at least one seller. 
Finally they price the resulting trade using their trade pricing rules

Although the trading rules vary considerably accross order-driven markets, all markets 
apply them the same way.


## Order Precedence Rules 

To arrange their trades, markets with order-matching systems use their order precedence 
rules to separately rank all buy and sell orders in order of increasing precedence. 
They match the orders with the highest precedence first. 

Order precedence are hierarchical, market use their primary order precendence rules to 
rank orders. if two or more orders have the same primary precedence, markets apply the 
secondary precedence rules to rank them. These rules are applied at one time until all 
orders are ranked by precedance. 

All order-matching system use price priority as their primary precendence rule. Under 
price priority, buy orders that bid the highest  prices and sell orders that bid the 
lowest prices rank highest on their respective sides. Market orders always rank 
highest because the prices at which they may trade is not limited. 

Markets use various secondary precedence rules to rank orders that have the same price. 
The most commonly used rules rank orders based on their time of submission, on their 
display status and on their size. All rules-based markets must have at least 
one secondary precedence rule. 

- Time precedence gives order precedence according to their time of submission  
- Display precedence gives precedence to orders that are disclosed 
- Size precedence varies by market. In some markets large orders have precedence over large orders; while in others the opposite holds 
- When two or more orders are at a parity, they cannot be filled fully, some market allocate available size on a prorata basis

## The Matching Procedure 

Order matching proceeds after the market ranks its orders. In a call market this happens 
whenever the market is called. In a continious market it happpens as new orders arrive. 

The market first matches the highest-ranking buy and sell orders to each others. 
If they buyer will pay at least as much as the seller demands, the match will result 
in a trade.  The price of the trade will depend on trade pricing rules of the market 

If one order is smaller than the other, the smaller order will fill completely. The market 
then will match the remainder of the larger order with the next highest-ranking order on 
the opposite side of the market.

If the first two orders are of the same size, both will fill completely. The market will then 
match the remainder of the larger order with the next highest-ranking order on the opposite 
side of the market. If the first two orders are of the same size both will fill completely. 
The market will then match the next highest ranking buy and sell orders. 

This process continues until the market arrange all possible trades. Since the market 
process orders ranked by decreasing price priority, the last match that result in a trade
often involves two orders that bid and offer at the same price. The next match does not 
result in a trade because the buyers bid price is below the seller's offer price.
