# Brokers

Brokers are agent who arrange trades for their clients. Unlike
dealers who trade with their clients, brokers trade with their
client's orders.

Many brokers are also financial advisers who advise their clients
about their investments or other financial plans. They may also provide
their clients with investment information.


==> Automated order execution systems are essentially electronic brokers
Since both traditional brokers and electronic order-matching systems
both match buyers and sellers, they compete with each other.

To fully understand either system, you must understand the economics of
both trading systems.


## What do Brokers Do

Brokers arrange trades for their clients. They search for traders
who are willing to trade with their clients, they represent their
clients at exchanges

==> Brokers conduct these activities in various types of
markets, in order flow markets, brokers take orders that their
client give them and match them with orders and quotes made by other traders

==> Exchanges, dealers, or the broker themselves may operate these markets
Brokers generally search for the best price only among traders who are
willing to display their limit orders and quotes in these markets.


==> In block markets, brokers take large client orders and try to find
other traders to fill them


==> Clients use brokers to arrange their trades because brokers usually
can arrange trades at a much lower cost than their clients can

    - Brokers solve clearing and settlement problems at a lower cost
    than their clients can

    - Brokers can access exchanges and dealers that their clients cannot
    access

    - Brokers generally know bettern than their clients who might be willing
    to trade.

    - Brokers are often better negociators than their clients are.

    - Brokers can represent orders for their clients when their clients
    are unable to represent themselves.


## Clearing and Settlement among traders

The most important, but perhaps the least appreciated reason, why
traders use brokers, is clearing and settlement. Clearning and
settlement problems can arise whenever traders do not settle their
trades immediately after they negociate them.

==> Without the assistance of brokers, traders would have to check
the credit worthiness of people they trade with for every trade

==> Brokers solve clearance problems by clearning their clients trades
If a client fails to acknowledge a trade the broker must resolve the
problem with the client.

==> Brokers can also efficiently solve the settlement credit problems
because they control assets that their clients deposit with them.

When a broker, settles a trade on behalf of the client, and the client
fails to settle with the broker, the broker can liquidate assets in  
the clients account to cover the trade.

## Brokers provide access to exchanges

Traders also use brokers because can provide access to exchanges that they
cannot access themselves. Exchanges generally allow only their members
to trade. Nonmembers who want to trade must have members arrange trades for them.


### Clearning and Settlement at Exchanges

Since order-driven exchanges often arrange trades among strangers, they generally
do not allow anyone to trade who does not have an approved credit relationshipt
with the exchange clearninghouse or with a clearing member who will guarantee
settlement of their trades.

## Brokers provide access to Dealers

Many traders use brokers to access dealers that they cannot access themselves
Brokers provide this service primarily to retail clients. Retail traders
rarely trade directly with dealers because credit, clearance, and settlement
relationships are expensive to establish.

Institutional clients often trade directly with dealers. Their large and
frequent trades make the costs of establishing direct access relationships
relatively small compared to the benefits of direct access.

## Brokers are Expert Traders

Brokers generally know more about who want to trade than do their clients.
They are better negotiators than are their clients.

### Block Brokers

The most successful block brokers know who wants to trade, and who would
want to trade if they wer presented with suitable trading opportunities.
They can predict what securities will interest their clients and at what
prices their clients will be interested.

==> They use this information to arrange trades.

### Better Negotiators   

==> Traders use brokers to negotiate transactions, especially very
large ones one their behalf. Good negotiators must be careful about
the information they reveal when negotiating.

### Brokers Provide Order Exposure Management

Traders whose orders are likely to move the market significantly do not
want to widely expose their orders. Traders either will stand out of the
way until the order has its impact on the market price., or they will trade
ahead of the order to profit from its expected price impact.

The traders who are most concerned about these issues are those ho
are widely known to be well informed and are known to trade in large
size.

### Brokers Represent Limit Orders

Many traders employ brokers to represent orders that they cannot
or do not want, to represent themselves. Clients who have other things
to do besides monitoring the market ofent give limit orders and stop
orders to their brokers to tell them what they want to do if market
conditions change. The brokers then monitor the market for them.


### Summary

Brokers provide many services to their clients. They help them identify
suitable counterparts, they help them negotiate their trades, they represent
their interests when they are unable or unwilling to represent them themselves.

reports for their clients. The sales brokers use this information to develop
relations with their clients.

trading activities of the firm and its clients.

or their depositories to hold them on their behalf. Traders often hold their
securiteis

They must collect dividens and interest payments, and properly assing them
to the appropriate client account.

#### Market Data and Order-Routing Systems

Brokerage firms invest heavily in data and voice systems that allow their
brokers to communicate with their clients, with markets, with dealers and with
each other. Third party vendors now mostly provide these systems.

===> The trading software industry has developped several communications protocols that makes it easier for systems developped by different vendors
to exchange information with each other. The most important of these protocols
are the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol and the Open Financial Exchange (OFE).
FIX primarlily serves institutional traders, and OFE primarily serves internet
based retail traders.

#### Credit Management

Brokerage firms often extend credit to their clients, to other brokers
and to dealers. The extend credit to clients when they allow clients who
have insufficient mony in their account to buy securities, when clients sell
securities that they do not have in their acccount, when they lend monly to clients on margin, and when they guarantee the their clients will settle Their
contracts.

must carefully evalute all credit relationships in which they are exposed
to potential loss.

clients comply with all applicable regulations. The regulation may conern
margins, trading practices, and client suitability. The compliance officers
of a brokerage firm usually reside in the Compliance Department of the Margin
Department of the firm.

suitable for their clients. A trade creats an unsuitable posiiton if the
client cannot afford the potential loss of the position or cannot reasonably
appreciate the risks.

Brokerage firms that hold client assets generally invest the cash and often
lend the securities. The cash managers of the firm try to keep all cash
balances fully invested. Brokers usually house their cash management
operations in the Cashier's department under the supervision of the firm's
cashier.

    legal risks to which the firm is exposed.
