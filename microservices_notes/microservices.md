## Escaping the monolithic hell 

==> Complexity intimidates developers,  
* Software that becomes too complex for developers to understand can be hard 
to improve or fix bugs. 

* If the codebase is too difficult to understand developers cannot make changes 
* correctly.

* Development is slow *

* The Path from commit to deployment is long and arduous 
One problem with so many devs commiting to the same codebase is that the build 
is frequently in an unreleasable state. using feature branches to solve this problem can also result in lengthy painful merges, consequently, once a team completes its sprint, a long period of testing and code stabilization follows.

Because the codebase is soo large
