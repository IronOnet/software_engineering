## PART II

Slide 1:
Title: Orchestration vs. Choreography

- Managing business processes that span beyond the boundaries of a single service
- Orchestration: Centralized approach with a conductor-like role
- Choreography: Distributed approach where each part of the system knows its job

Slide 2:
Title: Orchestration in E-commerce Platform

- Central brain: Customer service coordinates the process
- Request/response calls to loyalty points banks, email service, and post service

Slide 3:
Title: Choreography in E-commerce Platform

- Customer service emits CUSTOMER_CREATED event asynchronously
- Email service, postal service, and loyalty points banks subscribe to events and react accordingly

Slide 4:
Title: Characteristics of Orchestration and Choreography

- Orchestration: More tightly coupled, higher cost of change
- Choreography: More loosely coupled, more flexible and amenable to change

Slide 5:
Title: Synchronous Calls vs. Asynchronous Event Collaboration

- Synchronous calls: Simpler, immediate feedback on success
- Asynchronous event collaboration: Enables choreographed approach, more decoupled services

Slide 6:
Title: Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

- Technique of making a local call and executing it on a remote service
- An improvement over database integration for request/response collaboration

Slide 7:
Title: REST (Representational State Transfer)

- Inspired by the Web, with constraints and principles
- Resources as the central concept, decoupling external representation from internal storage

Slide 8:
Title: REST Over HTTP

- Reliant on HTTP protocols, most commonly used combination
- Features of HTTP (verbs) make implementing REST over HTTP easier

Slide 9:
Title: Downsides of REST Over HTTP

- Generating client stubs for REST over HTTP application protocols is not as straightforward as with RPC
- Some web frameworks may have limitations on supporting all HTTP verbs well
- Performance can be inferior to binary protocols like Thrift or Protocol Buffers

Slide 10:
Title: Implementing Asynchronous Event-Based Collaboration

- Message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka handle event emission and consumption
- Producers publish events to the broker, which handles subscriptions and informs consumers

Slide 11:
Title: Complexities of Asynchronous Architectures

- Event-driven architectures lead to more decoupled and scalable systems but introduce complexity
- Challenges in managing event flows and asynchronous communication

Slide 12:
Title: Reactive Extensions (Rx)

- Mechanism to compose results of multiple calls and perform operations on them
- Inverts traditional flows, observing outcomes and reacting to changes

Slide 13:
Title: DRY and Code Reuse in Microservices

- DRY principle aims to avoid duplicating system behavior and knowledge
- Code reuse in microservices can lead to coupling and brittleness

Slide 14:
Title: Guidelines for DRY in Microservices

- Avoid violating DRY within a microservice
- Be relaxed about violating DRY across services to prevent unnecessary coupling

## PART III

Slide 1:
Title: Versioning

- Managing changes to the interface of a service
- Strategies to reduce the impact of breaking changes

Slide 2:
Title: Defer Changes and Catch Breaking Changes Early

- Avoid making breaking changes whenever possible
- Choose the right integration technology to minimize breaks
- Detect and address breaking changes as early as possible

Slide 3:
Title: Semantic Versioning

- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format for versioning
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes
- MINOR: Backward compatible feature additions
- PATCH: Bug fixes to existing functionality

Slide 4:
Title: Coexistence of Different Endpoints

- Deploy a new version of the service with both old and new interfaces
- Allows gradual migration and smooth transition for consumers

Slide 5:
Title: Multiple Concurrent Service Versions

- Maintain different versions of the service simultaneously
- Older consumers route traffic to older versions, newer consumers use the new version

Slide 6:
Title: User Interfaces

- User interfaces bring microservices together for customers
- Web and mobile should be treated as digital solutions holistically

Slide 7:
Title: Constraints in User Interfaces

- Constraints vary based on device and platform (e.g., browser, resolution)
- Adapt core services to different constraints for each type of interface

Slide 8:
Title: API Composition

- User interface interacts directly with APIs (XML or JSON)
- UI components are recreated, and state synchronization is handled with the server
- Limited ability to tailor responses and potential inefficiencies in communication

Slide 9:
Title: UI Fragment Composition

- Services provide parts of the UI directly
- Assemble coarse-grained parts to create the UI
- Can be used for thick client applications or website pages

Slide 10:
Title: Backends for Frontends (BFF)

- Server-side aggregation endpoint or API gateway
- Restrict backend usage to specific user interfaces
- Prevent excessive logic in backend layers

Slide 11:
Title: Hybrid Approach

- Combine different UI composition styles based on requirements
- Fragment-based assembly for websites, BFF for mobile applications

Slide 12:
Title: Integrating with 3rd Party Software

- Build vs. Buy: Consider uniqueness and strategic value
- Challenges: lack of control, customization costs, integration complexity

Slide 13:
Title: On Your Own Terms

- Customize on a platform you control
- Limit the number of consumers of the third-party tool

Slide 14:
Title: The Strangler Pattern

- Deal with legacy or COTS platforms
- Intercept calls and route to legacy or new code gradually
- Replace functionality over time without a big rewrite

Slide 15:
Title: Summary

- Avoid database integration
- Consider REST as a starting point for integration
- Prefer choreography over orchestration
- Minimize breaking changes and versioning
- Think of user interfaces as compositional layers
