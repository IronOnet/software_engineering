# Some considerations before we start
  - The ideal integration tech 
  - Avoid breaking changes  
  - Keep your API technology agnostic
  - Make your services simple for consumers
  - Hide internal implementation details

# Interfacing with customers (Integration patterns)
  - The shared database
  - Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
  - Orchestration vs Choreography
  - Remote procedure calls
  - REST
  - Downsides of REST

# Implementing Asynchronous Event-Based Collaboration
  - Technology choices
  - Complexities of Asynchronous architectures

# DRY and the perils of code reuse in a Microservice World

# Versioning

  - Defer it for as long as possible
  - Use semantic versioning
  - Coexist different endpoints
  - Use multiple Concurrent service versions

# User interfaces
  - Towards digital (taken holistically)
  - Constraints
  - API composition  
  - UI Fragment Composition
  - Backend for Frontends

# Integrating with 3rd party software

  - Build if its unique to you
  - Lack of control
  - Customizatoin (Cost can be extremely high)
  -  Integration spaghetty
  - On your own term
  - The strangler pattern
