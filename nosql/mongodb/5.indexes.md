# Indexes

This chapter introduces MongoDB indexes. Indexes enable you to perform
queries efficiently. They're an important part of application development and
are even required for certain tyes of queries.

A database index is similar to a book's index. Instead of looking through
the whole book, the database takes a shortcut and just looks at an ordered
list with references to the content.
