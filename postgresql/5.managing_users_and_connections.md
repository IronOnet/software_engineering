# Managing Roles

```sql

-- Setting the password for a specific role does not
-- mean tha tthat role will be able to connect
-- to the cluster: in order to be allowed to  
-- interactively login, the role must also have
-- the login option
CREATE ROLE luca WITH PASSWORD 'xxx';


CREATE ROLE luca WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx';

-- Multiple options can be written in any order, so the preceding
-- code represent the same statemtn, but in a form that is less human
-- readable
CREATE ROLE luca WITH PASSWORD 'xxx' LOGIN;

-- The VALID UNTIL option allows you to define a date or even a timestamp
-- in the future
CREATE ROLE luca WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx' VALID UNTIL '2024-01-01 00:00:00';

```

### Using a Role as a group

A group is a role that contains other roles.


```sql 

CREATE ROLE book_authors;

CREATE ROLE

```
