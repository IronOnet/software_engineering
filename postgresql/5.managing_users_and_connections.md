# Managing Roles

```sql

-- Setting the password for a specific role does not
-- mean tha tthat role will be able to connect
-- to the cluster: in order to be allowed to  
-- interactively login, the role must also have
-- the login option
CREATE ROLE luca WITH PASSWORD 'xxx';


CREATE ROLE luca WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx';

-- Multiple options can be written in any order, so the preceding
-- code represent the same statemtn, but in a form that is less human
-- readable
CREATE ROLE luca WITH PASSWORD 'xxx' LOGIN;

-- The VALID UNTIL option allows you to define a date or even a timestamp
-- in the future
CREATE ROLE luca WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx' VALID UNTIL '2024-01-01 00:00:00';

```

### Using a Role as a group

A group is a role that contains other roles.


```sql

CREATE ROLE book_authors;

CREATE ROLE luca WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx' IN ROLE book_authors;

CREATE ROLE enrico WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'xxx' IN ROLE book_authors;

-- It is also possible to add members to a group
GRANT ROLE book_authors TO enrico;

--- Adding a user to another group with admin options
GRANT book_reviewers TO enrico WITH ADMIN OPTION;

```


## Removing an Existing Role

```sql

DROP ROLE [IF EXISTS] name [, ...];

-- In order to be deleted , the role must exist, therefore, if you try to remove
-- an nonexisting one you will receive an error
DROP ROLE this_role_does_not_exists;

```

## Inspecting existing roles

```sql

SELECT current_role;

```
