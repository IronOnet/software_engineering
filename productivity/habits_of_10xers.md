## 10 habits of 10X developers


    Take insane amount of notes
    Start to code only when they gather all information and requirements needed to implement a feature
    First reproduce the bug before looking into the code
    Validate results early and often with all stakeholders
    Effectively manage incoming messages and tasks
    Kick off day with an easy task to boost speed
    Make sure they work in a proper task order everyone is happy with
    Understand improving the development process as a part of their responsibilities
    Ask a lot of questions
    Value a team compromise more than their private opinions 11 bonus: master providing solutions rather than memorizing useless aspects of technologies
