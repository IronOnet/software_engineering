## Adding Interactivity

Some things on the screen update in response to user input. For example
clicking an image gallery switches the active image. In React, data that
changes over time is called state. you can add state to any component,
and update it as needed.

### Responding to events

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own
functions that will be triggered in response to user interaction like clicking
hovering, focusing on form inputs and so on.

Built-in components like <button> only support built-in browser events like
onClick. However, you can also create your own components, and give their
event handler props any application-specific names that you like.


```js

export default function App(){
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing')}
      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')}
    />
  )
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }){
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }){
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

```

### State: A component's Memory

Compoenent often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking
"nexgt" on an image carousel should change which image is displayed,
clicking "buy" puts a product in the shopping cart. components need to
"remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping
cart.

```js

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

```

Here is how an iamge gallery uses and updates state on click::

```js

import { useState } from "react";
import { sculptureList } from "./data.js";

export default functon Gallery(){
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(0);
  const hasNext = index < sculptureList.length

  function handleNextClick(){
    if(hasNext){
      setIndex(index + 1);
    } else{
      setIndex(0);
    }
  }

  function handleMoreClick(){
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureListt[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name}</i>
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>
        ({ index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide': 'Show'} details
      </button>
      <img
        src={scultpure.url}
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}

### Render and Commit

Before your components are displayed on the screen, they must be rendered  by
React. Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how
your code executes and explain its behavior.

React requests and serves UI in three steps:

1. Triggering a render
2. Rendering the component
3. Committing to the DOM

### State as a snapshot

Unlike regular Javascript Variables, React state behaves more like a snapshot.
Setting it does not change the state variable you already hav, but instead
triggers a re-render.

```js

let [count, setCount] = useState(0);
console.log(count+1); // Request a re-render with 1
console.log(count); // still 0

```

This behavior help you avoid subtle bugs. Here is a little chat app. Try
to guess what happens if you press ""

```js

export default function Form(){
  const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');

  function handleSubmit(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() =>{
      alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`);
    }, 5000);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        To:{' '}
        <select
          value={to}
          onChange={e => setTo(e.target.value)}
          <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
          <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        ></select>
      </label>
      <textarea
        placehoder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  )
}

```

### Qeueuing a series of state updates

This component is buggy: clicking "+3" increments the score by only once.

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter(){
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  function increment(){
    setScore(score + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={()=> increment()}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
        increment();
        increment();
      }}>+3</button>
      <h1>Score: {score}</h1>
  )
}

```

This bugs happens, because setting the state requests a new re-render, but
does not change it in the already running code. so score continues to be
O right after the call. setScore(score + 1);
We can fix this by passing an updateer function when setting state.
setScore(score + 1) with setScore(s => s + 1) fixes the "+3" button.
This lets you queue multiple state updates.

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter(){
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  function increment(){
    setScore(s => s + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => increment()}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
        increment();
        increment();
      }}>+3</button>
      <h1>Score: { score }</h1>
    </h1>
  )
}

```

### Updating Objects in state

State can hold any kind of Javascript value, including objects, but you
shouldn't change objects and arrays that you hold in the React state
directly. Instead, when you want to update an object and array, you
need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then
update the state to use that copy

Usually you will use the ... spread syntax to copy objects and arrays
that you want to change.

```js

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form(){
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork:{
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.Sd1AgUOm.jpg'
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    })
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork:{
        ...person.artwork,
        title: e.target.value
      }
    })
  }

  function handleCityChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork:{
        ...person.artwork,
        city: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork:{
        ...person.artwork,
        artwork{
          ...person.artwork,
          image: e.target.value
        }
      }
    })
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
          <input
            value={person.artwork.title}
            onChange={handleTitleChange}
          />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Image:
          <input
            value={person.artwork.image}
            onChange={handleImageChange}
          />
      </label>
      <p>
        <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
        {' by '}
        {person.name}
        (located in {person.artwork.city})
      </p>
      <img
        src={person.artwork.image}
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}


```

### Updating Arrays in state

Arrays are another type of mutable Javascript object you can store in state
and should treat as read-only. Just like object when you want to update
an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an
  existing one), and then set state to use the new array.


```js

import { useState } from "react";

let nextId = 3;
const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: "Big Bellies", seen: false},
  { id: 1, title: "Lunar Landscape", seen: false},
  { id: 2, title: "Terracotta Army", seen: true},
];

export default function BucketList(){
  const [list, setList] = useState(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggle(artworkId, nextSeen){
    setList(list.map(artwork =>{
      if(artwork.id === artworkId){
        return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen};
      } else{
        return artwork;
      }
    }));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>
      <h2>My List of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={list}
        onToggle={handleToggle}/>
    </>
  );
}

function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }){
  return (
    <ul>
      {artworks.map(artwork => (
        <li key={artwork.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={artwork.seen}
              onChange={e =>{
                onToggle(
                  artwork.id,
                  e.target.checked
                );
              }}
            />
            {artwork.title}
          </label>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
