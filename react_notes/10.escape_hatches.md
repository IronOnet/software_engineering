# Escape Hatches

Some of your components may need to control and synchronize with systems outside
of React. for example, you might need to focus an input using the browser API,
play and puase a video player implemented without React, or connect and listen
to messages from a remote server. In this chapter, you'll learn the escape
hatches that let you "step outside" React and connect to external systems.

## Referencing values with refs

When you want a component to "remember" some information, but you don't want
that information to trigger new renders, you can use a ref:

```js

const ref = useRef(0);
```

Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However setting
state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not! You can access the current
value of that ref through the ref.current property.

```js

import { useRef } from "react";

export default function Counter(){
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick(){
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert("You clicked", + ref.current + ' timestamp');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
       Click me!
    </button>
  )
}

```

## Manipulating DOM with refs

React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components
won't often need to manipulate it. However sometimes, you might need access the DOM
elements managed by React for example, to focus a node, scroll to it.

```js

import { useRef } from "react";

export default function Form(){
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick(){
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Focus on the input
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

```

## Synchronizing with Effects

Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might
want to control an on React component based on The React state, set up a server
connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen.
Unlike event handlers, which let you handle particular events, Effects let
you some code after rendering. Use them to syncrhonize your component with a
system tside of React.

Press Play/Pause a few time


```js

import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }){
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() =>{
    if(isPlaying){
      ref.current.play();
    } else{
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline/>;
}

export default function App(){
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        { isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-example.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cco-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}

```

Many effects also "clean up" after themselves. For example, an effect that
sets up a connection to a chat server should return a cleanup function that tells
React how to disconnect your component from that server

```js

// App.js

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createConnection } from "./chat.js";

export default function ChatRoom(){
  useEffect(() =>{
    const connection = createConnecton();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>
}

// Chat.js

export function createConnection(){
  return {
    connect(){
      console.log('>> Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect(){
      console.log('xxx Disconnected.');
    }
  }
}

```

## You might not need an effect

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you "step outside"
of React and syncrhonize your components with some external system. If there is no
external system involved (for example, if you want to update) a component's
state when some some props or state change) you shouldn't need an Effect.
Removing unecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to
run and less error-prone

```js

function Form(){
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  const [fullName, setFullName]  = useState('');
  useEffect(() =>{
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
}

```

Instead, calculate as much as you can while rendering:

```js

function Form(){
  const [firstName, setFirstName ] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
}

```

## Lifecycle of reactive effects

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update
or unmount An effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something,
and later stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your
effect depends on props and state that change overtime.

This Effect depends on the value of the roomId prop. Props are reactive values
which means they can change on a re-render. Notice that the effect re-syncrhonizes
(and re-connects to the servers) if roomId changes:

```js

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createConnection } from "./Chat.js";

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

funciton ChatRoom({ roomId }){
  useEffect(() =>{
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App(){
  const [roomId, setRoomId ] = useState('general conversation');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">General</option>
          <option value="travel">Travel</option>
          <option value="music">Music</option>
        </label>
        </hr>
        <ChatRoom roomId={roomId}/>
      </>
  )
}
```

## Separating events from State

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike
event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values the read, like props
or state, are different than during the last render. Sometimes, you want both
behaviors: an Effect in response to some values but not others.

All code inside effects is reactive. It will run again if some reactive value it
reads has changed due to a render.

```js

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from "./Chat"
