# Adding Interactivity

## Responding to Events

React lets you add event handler to your JSX. Event handler are your
own functions to be triggered in response to interactions like
clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

### Adding event handlers

To add an event handler, you will first define a function and then pass it
as prop. to the appropriate JSX tag. for example,

```js

export default function Button(){

  function handleClick(){
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }
  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}

```

#### Caution

Function passed to event handler must be passed not called.
The difference is subtle.

```js

<button onClick={handleClick}</button>
!<button conClick={handleClick()}></button>

```

If you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous funciton
like so:

```js

<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>
```

Rather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function
to be called later. In both cases, what you want to pass is a function:

- <button onClick={handleClick}> handleClick function
- <button onClick={() => alert('...')}> passes the () => alert('...') function

### Reading props in event handlers

Because event handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access
to the component's props. Here is a button that, when clicked, shows an
alert with its messsage prop.


```js

function AlertButton({ message, children }){
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert(message)}</button>
  )
}

export default function Toolbar(){
  return (
    <div>
      <AlertButton message="Playing!">
        Play Movie
      </AlertButton>
      <AlertButton message="Uploading!">
        Upload
      </AlertButton>
    </div>
  );
}

```

#### Passing event handlers as props

Often you'll want the parent component to specify a child's event handler.
Consider buttons: depending on where you're using a Button component, you
might want to execute a different function. perhaps one plays a move and
another uploads an image.

To do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event
handler like so:

```JS

function Button({onClick, children}){
  return(
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

function PlayButton({movieName }){
  function handlePlayClick(){
    alert(`Playing ${movieName}`);
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>
      Play "{movieName}"
    </Button>
  )
}

function UploadButton(){
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => alert('uploading!')}>
      Upload Image
    </Button>
  )
}

export default function ToolBar(){
  return (
    <div>
      <PlayButton movieName="Kiki delivery Service"/>
      <UploadButton/>
    </div>
  )
}

```

### Naming event handler props

Built-in components like <button> and <div> only support browser event names
like onClick. However, when you're building your own components, you can
name their event handler props any way that you like.

By convention, event handler props should start with on, followed by a capital
letter. For example, the Button component's onClick prop could have been
called onSmash

```js

function Button({ onSmash, children }){
  return (
    <button onClick={onSmash}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App(){
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Playing')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Uploading')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

When your component supports multiple interactions, you might name event
handler props for app-specific concepts. For example, this Toolbar component
receives onPlayMovie and onUploadImage event handlers:

```js

export default function App(){
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing')}
      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading')}
    />
  );
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }){
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }){
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

````

### Event Propagation

Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might
have. Wen say that an event "bubbles" or "propagates" up the three. it starts
with where the event happened, and then goes up the three.

```js

export default function Toolbar(){
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() =>{
      alert("You clicked on the toolbar!");
    }}>
      <button onClick={() => alert("Playing!")}>
        Play Movie
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => alert("Uploading")}
  )
}

```

If you click on either button, its onClick will run first, followed by the
parent <div>'s onClick. So two messages will appears

### ==> Pitfall : All events propagage in React except onScroll, which only
works on the JSX tag you attach it to.

### Stopping Propagation

Event handlers receive an event object as their only argument. By convention
it's usually called e, which stands for "event". You can use this object
to read information about the event.

That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent
an event from reaching parent components, you need to call e.stopPropagation()
like this Button component does

```js

function Button({ onClick, children }){
  return (
    <button onClick={e => (
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    )}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar(){
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() =>{
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

When you click a button:

   1. React calls the onClick handler passed to <button>
   2. That handler, defined in Button, does the following:
      - Calls e.stopPropagation(), preventing the event from bubbling further
      - Calls onClick() function, which is a prop passed from the Toolbar component.

    3. That function, defined in the Toolbar component, displays the button's onw alert
    4. Since the propagation was stoppped, the parent <div> onClick handler does
    not run.

As a result of e.stopPropagation(), clicking on the buttons now only shows a
single alert (from the <button>) rather than the two of themes

#### Passing handlers as alternative to propagation

You could add more code to the above handler, this lets the child component
handle the event, while also letting the parent component, specify some
additional behavior. Unlike propagation, it's not automatic. But the
benefit of this pattern is that you can clearly follow the whole chain
of code that executes as a result of some event.


### Preventing the default behavior

Some browsers have default behavior associated with them. For example a <form>
submit event which happens when a button insde of it is clicked, will reload
the whole page by default:

```js

export default function Signup(){
  return (
    <form onSumbit={() => alert('Submitting')}>
      <input/>
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

```

You can call e.preventDefault() on the event object to stop this from
happening:

```js

export default function Signup(){
  return (
    <form onSumbit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Submitting');
    }}>
      <input/>
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

```

Don't confuse e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault(), they are both useful,
but are unrelated:

- e.stopPropagation() stops the event handlers attached to the tags above the firing
- e.preventDefault() prevents the default behavior to the few events that have it.

### Can event handlers have side effects?

Event handlers have side effect, unlike rendering functions event handlers
don't need to be pure
