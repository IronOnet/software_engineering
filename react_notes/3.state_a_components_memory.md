Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an
interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field.
clicking "next" on an image carousel should change which image is
displayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart.

## When a regular variable isn't enough

```js

import { sculptureList } from "./data.js"

export default function Gallery(){
  let index = 0

  function HandleClick(){
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
    </>
    ...
  )
}

```

The handleClick event handler is updating a local variable, index. But two
things prevent that change from being visible:

1. Local variables don't persist between renders. When React renders this
component a second time, it renders it from scratch, it doesn't consider
any changes to the local variables.

2. Changes to local variables won't trigger renders. React doesn't realize it
needs to render the component again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. Retain the data between renders
2. Trigger React to render the component with the new data (re-rendering)

The useState Hook provides those two things:

1. A state variable to retain the data between renders
2. A state setter function to update the variables and trigger React to render
the component again

===> Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering
The ylet you "hook into" different React features.
State is just on of these features, but you will meet the other hooks later.


====> Pitfall: Hooks function starting with use can only be called at the top
level of your component or your own Hooks. You can't call Hooks inside conditions
loops or other nested functions.


===> Anatomy of use state

```js

import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery(){
  const [index , setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick(){
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick(){
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculputure = sculptureList[index];

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name}</i>
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>
        ({{ index + 1}} of { sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description }</p>}
      <img
        src={sculpture.artist}
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### State is isolated and Private

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you
render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated
state! changing one of them will not affect the other.

In the following example, the Gallery component from earlier is rendered
twice with no changes to its logic.

```js

import { useState } from "react";
import { sculptureList } from "./data.js";

export default function Gallery(){
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick(){
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick(){
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];

  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name}</i>
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>
        ({ index + 1} of {sculptureList.length });
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide': 'Show'} details
      </button>
      { showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img
        src={sculpture.url}
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </section>
  );
}

/// App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App(){
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery/>
      <Gallery/>
    </div>
  );
}

```

### Recap  

- Use a sate variable when a component needs to remember some information
between renders
- State variables are declared by calling the useState Hook.
- Hooks are special functions that start with use. They let you hook into react
features like state.
- Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally.
Calling hooks including useState, is only valid at the top level of a compoennt
or another hook
- The useState Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the funciton
to update it.
- You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up
by their order.
- State is private to the component. If you render it in two places
