## Render and Commit

Before your compmoentns are displayed on screen, they must be rendered by
React. Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about
how your code executes and explain its behavior.

In react requesting and serving the UI happens in three steps:

1. A render is Triggered
2. A component is Rendered
2. The component is commited to the DOM


### 1. Trigger a Render

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It's the components initial render
2. The component's (or one of its ancestors) state has been updated

When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render. Frameworks
and sandboxes sometimes hide this code, but it's done by calling
createRoot with the taret DOM node.

```js

// Image.js
export default function Image(){
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Générica' by Eduardo Catalaoun"
    />
  )
}

import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image/>);

```

#### Re-renders when state updates

Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further
renders by updating its state with the set function. Updating your component's
state automatically queues a render.

### 2. React renders your components

After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what
to display on screen. "Rendering is react calling your components."

- On initial render, React will call th eroot component.
- For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose
state update triggered the render.

This process is recursive: if the uploaded component returns some other component
React ill render that component next, and if that component also returns
something, it will render that component next, and so on.

### 3. React commit changes to the DOM

After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.

- For the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all
the DOM nodes it has created on screen.

- For the re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

- React only changes the DOM nodes if there's a difference between renders.
For example,

### Epilogue

After rendering is done React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint
the screen. Although this process is known as browser rendering it is
refered to as browser painting in the official React doc

### Recap

Any screen update in a React app happens in three steps:

1. Trigger
2. Render  
3. Commit

- You can use strict mode to find mistakes in your components
- React does not touch the DOM if the rendering result is the same
as the last time.
