# Queueing a Series of State Updates

Setting a state variable will queue another render. But sometimes you
might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing
the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React
batches state updates.


## React batches state updates

You might expect that clicking the "+3" button will increment the counter three
times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times


## Recap

- Setting the state does not change the variable in the existing render, but
it requests a new render.
- React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This
is called batching
- To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use setNumber(n => n + 1) updater functon
