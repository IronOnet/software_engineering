# Updating Objects in State

State can hold any kind of javascript value, including objects.
But you shouldn't change objects that you hold in the React
state directly, instead, when you want to update an object ,
you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one),  
and then set the state to use that copy.

## You'll learn

- How to correctly update an object in React state
- How to update a nested object without mutating it
- What immutability is, and how not to break it
- How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer


## What's a mutation?

Consider the object in state:

```js

const [position, setPosition ] = useState({x: 0, y : 0});
```

It is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is
called a mutation:

```js

position.x = 5;
```

However although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should
treat them as if they were immutable, like numbers, booleans, and strings.
Instead of mutating them, you should replace them.


### Treat state as read-only

In other words, you should treat any Javascript object that you put into
a state as read-only.
The following example holds an object in state to represent the current
pointer posiiton. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch
or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial
position.

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function MovingDot(){
  const [position, setPosition ] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e =>{
        position.x = e.clientX;
        position.y = e.clientY;
      }}
      style={{
        position:'relative';
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The above code modifies the object assigned to position from the previous
render. But without using the state setting function, React has no
idea that the object has changed. So react does not do anything in response.
its like trying to change the order after you've already eaten the meal.

Mutating the state is not a recommended practice. You should treat the state
value you have access to in a render as read-only.

To actually trigger a re-render in this case, create a new object and pass it
to the state setting function:

```js

onPointerMove={e =>{
  setPosition({
    x: e.clientX,
    y: e.clientY
  });
}}
```

With setPosition, you're telling React:

- Replace position with this new object
- And render this component again.

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function MovingDot(){
  const [position, setPosition ] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  });

  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e =>{
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position:'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `transform(${position.x}px), transform(${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

### Copying objects with the spread syntax

You can use the ... object spread syntax so that you don't need to copy
every property separately.

```js

setPerson({
  ...person,
  firstName: e.target.value
});

```

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form(){
  const [person, setPerson ] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      firstName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...,
      lastName: e.target.value
    })
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e){
    setPerson({
      ...,
      email: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First Name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last Name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
         />
        </label>
        <label>
          Email:
          <input
            value={person.email}
            onChange={handleEmailChange}
          />
        </label>
      </>
  );
}

```

### Updating A nested object

consider a nested object structure like the following:

```js

const [person, setPerson ] = useState({
  name: 'Nikki de saint Phalle',
  artwork:{
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jgp',
  }
});

```

```js

// If you want to update person.artwork.city, it's clear how to
// do it with mutation:
person.artwork.city = 'New Dehli';

// But in React you treat state as immutable! in order to
// change city, you would first need to produce the new
// artwork object (pre-populated with daa from the previous one)
// and then produce the new person object which points at the
// new artwork:

const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Dehli'};
const nextPerson = {...person, artwork: nextArtwork}
setPerson(nextPerson);

// Or written as a single function call
setPerson({
  ...person,
  artwork:{
    ...person.artwork,
    city: 'Dehli'
  }
});

```

### Objects are not really nested

An object like this appears "nested" in code:

```js

let obj = {
  name: "Nikki de Saint Phalle",
  artwork:{
    title: "Blue Nana",
    city: "Hamburg",
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg",
  }
};
```

### Writing consise update logic with Immer

If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider flattening it.
But if you don't want to change your state structure, you might prefer
a shortcut to nested spreads. Immer is a popular library that lets you
write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of
producing the copies for you.


```js

updatePerson(draft =>{
  draft.artwork.city = 'Kinshasa';
});

```

But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn't overwrite the past state.

```js

import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';

export default function Form(){
  const [person, updatePerson] = useImmer({
    name: 'Nikki De Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jgp'
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e){
    updatePerson(draft =>{
      draft.name = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e){
    updatePerson(draft =>{
      draft.artwork.title = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e){
    updatePerson(draft =>{
      draft.artwork.city = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e){
    updatePerson(draft =>{
      draft.artwork.image = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
          <input
            value={person.artwork.title}
            onChange={handleTitleChange}
          />
       </label>
       <label>
        City
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
         />
        </label>
        <label
          Image:
          <input
            value={person.artwork.image}
            onChange={handleImageChange}
          />
        </label>
        <p>
          <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
          {' by '}
          {person.name}
          <br/>
          (located in { person.artwork.city })
        </p>
        <img
          src={{ person.artwork.image }}
          alt={{person.artwork.title}}
        />
        </>
  )
}


```

### Recap

- Treat all state in React as immutable
- When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders
and will change the state in previous render "snapshots"
- Instead of mutating an object, create a new version of it, and trigger a
re-render by setting state to it.
- You can use the {...obj, something: 'newValue'} object spread syntax to create
copies of objects
- Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
- To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from
the place you're updating.
- To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.
