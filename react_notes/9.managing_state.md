## Managing State

As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about
how your state is organized and how the data flows between your
components. Redundent or duplicate


## Reacting to input with state

With react you won't modify the UI from code directly. For example,
you won't write commands like "disable" the button, "enable the button",
instead you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual
states of your component ("initialState", "typing state", "success state")
and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is
similar to how designer think about UI

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form(){
  const [answer, setAnswer ] = useState('');
  const [error, setError ] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

  if(status === 'success'){
    return <h1>Thats Right!</h1>
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus('submitting');
    try{
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus('success');
    } catch(err){
      setStatus('typing');
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextAreaChange(e){
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City Quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextAreaChange}
          disabled={state === 'submitting'}
        />
        <br/>
        <button disabled={
          answer.length === 0 ||
          status === "submitting"
        }>
          Submit
        </button>
        { error !== null &&
        <p className="Error">
          {error.message}
        </p>
      }
  )
}

function submitForm(answer){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{
    setTimeout(() =>{
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() != 'lima' ? true: false
      if(shouldError){
        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer'))
      } else{
        resolve()
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}

```

### Choosing the state structure

Structuring the state well can make a difference between a compoennt that
is pleasant to modify and debug and one that is a constant source of bugs.
The most important principle is that the state should'nt contain redundant
or duplicated information. If there's unecessary state, it's easy to forget
to update it, and introduct bugs.


```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form(){
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useStatet('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

  function handleFirstNameChange(e){
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
    //setFullName(e.target.value + ' ' + lastName)
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e){
    setLastName(e.target.value);
    //setFullName(firstName + '' + e.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Lets check you in</h2>
      <label>
        First Name: {' '}
        <input
          value={firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last Name: {' '}
        <input
          value={lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      /label>
      <p>Your ticket will be issued to {fullName}</p>
    </>
  );
}

```

## Sharing state beween components

Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together.
To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common
parent, and then pass them via props.

```js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Accordion(){
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex ] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        With a poplation of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan*s
        largest city. From 1929 to 1997 it was its capital city
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the kazhak word
        for apples and is often translated as "full of apples"...
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({
  title,
  children,
  isActive,
  onShow
}){
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={onShow}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  )
}

```

## Preserving and resetting the state

When you re-render a component, React needs to decide which parts of the
three to keep (and update), and which parts to discard or re-create from
scratch.  most cases, React's automatic behavior works well enough.   
By default  that React preserves the parts of the three that match up
with the previously rendered component tree.

However sometimes this is not what you want, In this chat app, typing a
mesage then switching the recipent does not reset the input.
This can make the user accidentally send a message to the wrong person.

```js

/// App js

import { useState } from "react";
import Chat from "./Chat.js";
import ContactList from "./ContactList.js";

export default function Messenger(){
  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);
  return (
    <div>
      <ContactList
        contacts={contacts}
        selectedContact={to}
        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}
      />
      <Chat contact={to}/>
    </div>
  )
}


const contacts = [
  { name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@email.com'},
  { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@email.com'},
  { name: 'Bernard', email: 'bernard@email.com'},
];


// ContactList.js

export default function ContactList({
  selectedContact,
  contacts,
  onSelect
}){
  return (
    <section className="contact-list">
      <ul>
        {contacts.map(contact =>
        <li key={contact.email}>
          <button onClick={() => {
            onSelect(contact);
          }}>
            {contact.name}
          </button>
        </li>)}
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}

// Chat.js

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Chat({ contact }){
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <section className="chat">
      <textArea
        value={text}
        placeholder={'Chat to' + contact.name}
        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <b
  )
}

```

React lets you override the default behavior, and force a compoent,
to reset its state by passing it a different key, ike
<Chat key={email} />. This tells react that if the recipent is different
it should be considered a different Chat compoennt the needs to be re-created
from scratch with the new data (and UI like inputs).

```js

import { useSate } from "react";
import Chat from "./Chat.js";
import ContactList from "./ContactList.js";

export default function Messenger(){
  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);
  return (
    <div>
      <ContactList
        contacts={contacts}
        selectContact={to}
        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}
      />
      <Chat key={to.email} contact={to}/>
    </div>
  )
}

const contacts = [
  {},
  {},
  {},
]

```

## Extracting State logic into a reducer

Components with many state updates spread accross many event handlers can
get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state
update logic outside your component in a single function,
called "reducer". Your event handlers become concise because they only
specify the user "actions". At the bottom of the file, the reducer
function specifies how the state should update in response to each action!

```js

import { useReducer } from "react";
import AddTask from "./AddTask.js";
import TaskList from "./TaskList.js";

export default function TaskApp(){
  const [tasks, dispatch ] = useReducer(
    taskReducer,
    initialTasks
  );

  function handleAddTask(text){
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task){
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId){
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague Itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask
        onAddTask={handleAddTask}
      />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />

    </>
  );
}

function taskReducer(tasks, action){
  switch(action.type){
    case 'added':{
      return [...tasks,{
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed':{
      return tasks.map(t =>{
        if(t.id === action.task.id){
          return action.task;
        }
      })
    }
    case: 'deleted':{
      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.task.id)
    }
    default:{
      throw Error('Uknown action:' action.type);
    }
  }
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Work on linkedin problems', done : false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Build the FTGO app', done: false},
]

```


### Consolidate state logic with a reducer

As your component grows in complexity, it can get harder to see at glance
all the different ways in which a component's state gets updated.  
For example the TaskApp component below holds an array of tasks
in state and uses three different event handlers to add remove,
and edit tasks


```js

import { useState } from "react";
import AddTask from "./AddTask.js";
import TaskList from "./TaskList.js";

export default function TaskList(){
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text){
    setTasks([
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: nextId++,
        text: text,
        done: false,
      }
    ])
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task){
    setTasks(
      tasks.map((t) =>{
        if(t.id === task.id){
          return task
        } else{
          return t
        }
      })
    );
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(task){
    setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== task.id));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Kinshasa Itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask}/>
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit The National Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Visit The Stade des Martyrs', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Visit the Congo River', done: false},
  {id: 4, text: 'Mont-Ngaliema', done: false},
];

```

Each of its event handlers calls setTasks in order to update the state.
As this component grows, so does the amount of state logic sprinkled throughout
it. To reduce complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access
place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your
component, called a "reducer".

Reducers are a different way to handle the state. You can migrate from
useState to useReducer in three steps:

1. Move from setting state to dispatching actions
2. Write a reducer function
3. Use the reducer from your component

After removing all the state handling logic you are left with three event
handlers:

- handleAddTask(text) is called when the user presses "Add"
- handleChangeTask(task) is called when the user toggles a task or presses
"Save"
- handleDeleteTask(taskId) is called when the user presses delete.

Managing state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting
state. Instead of telling React what to do by setting state, you specify
what the user did by dispatching actions from your event handlers.
(The state update logic will live somewhere!)

```js

function handleAddTask(text){
  dispatch({
    type: 'added',
    id: nextId++,
    text: text
  });
}


function handleChangeTask(task){
  dispatch({
    type: 'changed',
    task: task,
  })
}

function handleDeleteTask(taskId){
  dispatch({
    type: 'deleted',
    id: taskId,
  });
}

```

The object you pass to dispatch is called an "action"

```js

function handleDeleteTask(){
  dispatch(
    {
      type: "deleted",
      id: taskId,
    }
  );
}
```

It is a regular javascript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally
it should contain the minimal information about what happened. (You will add
  the dispatch function in a later step).

===> By convention, it is common to give the object a string "type" that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields.
The type is specific to a component, so in this example either "added" or
"added_task" would be fine.

```js

dispatch({
  type: 'what_happened'
});

```

### Step 2 Write a reducer Function

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two
arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the
next state:

```js

function yourReducer(state, action){
  // Return next state for react to set.
}

```

React will set the state to what, you return from the reducer.

To move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer
function in this example, you will:

1. Declare the current state (tasks) as the first argument.
2. Declare the action object as the second argument
3. Return the next state from the reducer (which React will set the state to).


```js

function taskReducer(tasks, action){
  if(action.type === "added"){
    return [
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false,
      },
    ];
  } else if(action.type === "changed"){
    return tasks.map((t) => {
      if (t.id === action.task.id){
        return action.task;
      } else{
        return t;
      }
    });
  } else if (action.type === "deleted"){
    return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
  } else{
    throw Error('Uknown action: ' + action.type);
  }
}

```

Because the reducer function takes state (tasks) as an argument, you can
declare it outsideé of your component. This decreases the indentation level
and can make your code easier to read.

```js

function tasksReducer(tasks, action){
  switch(action.type){
    case 'added':{
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed':{
      return tasks.map((t) =>{
        if(t.id === action.task.id){
          return action.task;
        } else{
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted':{
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default:{
      throw Error('Uknown action:' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

```

### Step 3 use the reducer from your component

The "useReducer" hook is similar to useState, you must pass it as an initial
state and it returns a stateful value and way to set state (in this case,
  the dispatch function) but it's a little different.

The reducer hook takes two arguments:

1. A reducer function
2. An initial state

And it returns:

1. A stateful value
2. A dispatch function (to dispatch user actions to the reducer)

```js

import { useReducer } from "react";
import AddTask from "./AddTask.js";
import TaskList from "./TaskList.js";

export default function TaskApp(){
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(taskReducer);

  function handleAddTask(text){
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    })
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId){
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague Itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask}/>
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function taskReducer(tasks, action){
  switch(action.type){
    case 'added':{
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed':{
      return tasks.map((t) =>{
        if(t.id === action.task.id){
          return action.task;
        } else{
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted':{
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default:{
      throw Error("Unknown action: " + action.type);
    }
  }
}

```

===> Writing Reducers Well:

- Reducers must be pure: Similar to state updater functions, reducers run
during rendering! (Actions are queued) until the next render) this means that
reducers must be pure - same inputs always result in the same output.

- Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple
changes in the data. For example, if a user presses "Reset" on a form with
five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one reset_form.

## Recap

To convert from useState to useReducer:

1. dispatch actions from event handlers
2. Write a function that returns the next state for a given state and action
3. Replace useState with useReducer

- Reducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and
testing
- Reducers must be pure.
- Each action describes a single user interaction.
- User immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style.


# Passing Data Deeply with Context

Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component
via props. But passing props can become verbose and incovenient if you have to pass
them through many components in the middle.

## Context: an alternative to passing props

Context lets a parent component provide data to the entiere tree below it.
There are many uses for context. Here is one example.

```js

import Heading from "./Heading.js";
import Section from "./Section.js";

export default function Page(){
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading>
      <Heading level={2}>Title</Heading>
      <Heading level={3}>Title</Heading>
      <Heading level={4}>Title</Heading>
    </Section>
  );
}

// Section.js

export default function Section({ children }){
  return (
    <section className="section">
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}

// Heading.js
export default funciton Heading({ level, children }){
  switch(level){
    case 1:
      return <h1>{childre}</h1>;
    case 2:
      return <h2>{children}</h2>;
    case 3:
      return <h3>{children}</h3>;
    case 6:
      return <h6>{children}</h6>;
    default:
      throw Error('Uknown level: ' + level);
  }
}

```

Let's say you want multiple headings with the same Section to always have
the same size:

```js

// App.js

import Heading from "./Heading";
import Section from "./Section";

export default function Page(){
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading>
      <Section>
        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>
        <Section>
          <Heading level={3}>Heading</Heading>
          <Heading level={3}>Heading</Heading>
          <Heading level={3}>Heading</Heading>
          <Section>
            <Heading level={4}>Heading</Heading>
            <Heading level={4}>Heading</Heading>
          </Section>
        </Section>
      </Section>
    </Section>
  )
}

```

Currently, you pass the level prop to each <Heading> separately.
It would be nice if you could pass the level prop to the <Section> component
instead and remove it from the <Heading>. This way you could enforce all
headings in the same section to have the same size:


```js

<Section level={3}>
  <Heading>About</Heading>
  <Heading>Photos</Heading>
  <Heading>Videos</Heading>
</Section>

```

But how can the <Heading> component know the level of its closest <Section>?
That would be a way for a child to "ask" for data from somewhere above in the
three.

You can't do it with props alone. This is where context comes into play. You will
do it in three steps:

1. Create a context. (You can call it LevelContext, since it's for the heading level)
2. Use that context from the component that needs the data (Heading will use LevelContext)
3. Provide that context from the component that specifies the data (Section will provide
  LevelContext)

Context lets a parent, even a distant one, provide data to the entire three inside it.


```js

// Create the Context

// LevelContext.js

import { createContext } from "react";
export const LevelContext = createContext(1);

// The only one argument to createContext is the default value. Here 1 refers
// to the biggest heading level, but you could pass any kind of value (even an object)
// You could pass any kind of value (even an object). You will see the
// significance of the default value in the next step

// Use the context  

import { useCcontext } from "react";
import { LevelContext } from "./LevelContext.js";

export default function Heading({ children }){
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  //..
}

// When updated our JSX will look like this
(() =>{
  <Section level={4}>
    <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
    <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
    <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
  </Section>
})

// Step 3 Provide the context

// The section component currently renders its children

export default function Section({ children }) {
  return (
    <section className="secton">
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}

// Wrap them with a context provider to provide the LevelContext to them:

import { LevelContext } from "./LevelContext.js";

export default function Section({ level, children }){
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    <section>
  );
}

```

This tells React: "if any compoennt inside the <Section> asks for LevelContext" give
them this level. the compoentn will use the value of the nearest <LevelContext.Provider> in the UI tree above it.

## Use cases for context

- Theming: If your app lets the user change its appearance, you can put a context
provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust
their visual look.

- Current account: many components might need to know the currently logged in user.
Putting it in context makes it conventinet to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps
also let you operate multiple account

- Routing: most routing solutions use context internally to hold the curent route
This is how every link "knows" whether it's active or not. If you build your own
router you might want to do it too.

- Managing state: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to
the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it.

Context is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next
render, React will update all the components reading it below!

## Recap

- Context lets a component provide some information to the entire three below it.
- To pass context:
    1. Create an export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue)
    2. Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component
    3. Wrap the children <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent

- Context passes through any compoennt in the middle
- Context lets you write components that adapt to their surroundings
- Before you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children.
