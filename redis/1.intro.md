# The Basics

Redis is often described as an in-memory persistent key-value store.
Redis exposes five different data structures, only one of which is a typical
key-value structure.

- HashSets
- Lists: Lists let you store and manipulate an array of values for a given keys
You can add values to the list, get the first or last value and manipulate values
at a given index. Lists maintain their order and have efficient index-based operations.
We could have a newusers list which tracks the newest registered users to our site

- Sets

Sets are used to store unique values and provide a number of set-based operations like
unions. Sets aren't ordered but they provide efficient value-based operations.

- Sorted sets:

The last and most powerful data structure are sorted sets. If hashes are like strings
but with fields, then sorted sets are like sets but with a score. The score provides sorting
and ranking capabilities. If we wanted a ranked list of friends, we might do:

```bash

zadd friends:leto 100 ghania 95 paul 95 chani 75 jessica 1 vladimir

```
