# Manage Complexity with Meaning ful models

## Reason About the Architecture

Turn problem solvin into massively parallel operatoin by collaborating with
other humans. Another involves creating new, abstract concepts to represent
chunks of knowlege.

Good architecture models have many benefits:

  - Models establish the vocabulary of design

  - Models direct our attention to interesting details

  - Models allow us to reason about quality attributes and other
  system properties  

  - Models capture the architect's intent: All developer should understand
  why we designed the system the way we did.

A software system's architecture meta-model defines the concepts used
in a model and the rules for how those concepts are applied. The meta model
is like a cognitive grammar for design
