# Conditional Logic

In certain situations you may want your SQL logic to branch in one direction
or another depending on the values of certain columns or expressions.

```sql

SELECT first_name, last_name
CASE
  WHEN active = 1 THEN 'ACTIVE'
  ELSE 'INACTIVE'
END activity_type
FROM customer
```

+-------------+--------------+---------------+
| first_name | last_name | activity_type |
+-------------+--------------+---------------+
| MARY | SMITH | ACTIVE |
| PATRICIA | JOHNSON | ACTIVE |
| LINDA | WILLIAMS | ACTIVE |
| BARBARA | JONES | ACTIVE |
| ELIZABETH | BROWN | ACTIVE |
| JENNIFER | DAVIS | ACTIVE |
...
| KENT | ARSENAULT | ACTIVE |
| TERRANCE | ROUSH | INACTIVE |
| RENE | MCALISTER | ACTIVE |
| EDUARDO | HIATT | ACTIVE |
| TERRENCE | GUNDERSON | ACTIVE |
| ENRIQUE | FORSYTHE | ACTIVE |
| FREDDIE | DUGGAN | ACTIVE |
| WADE | DELVALLE | ACTIVE |
| AUSTIN | CINTRON | ACTIVE |
+-------------+--------------+---------------+
599 rows in set (0.00 sec)

This query includes a case expression to generate a value for the activity_type
column, which returns the string "ACTIVE" or "INACTIVE" depending on the value
of the customer.active column.

case expressions may return any type of expression, including subqueriies.
Here's another version of the query from earlier

```sql

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
CASE
WHEN active = 0 THEN 0
ELSE
(SELECT count(*) FROM rental r
WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id)
END num_rentals
FROM customer c;
```

### The Simple case Expressions

The simple case expression is quite similar to the searched case expression
but is a bit less flexible.

CASE V0
  WHEN V1 THEN E1
  WHEN V2 THEN E2
  ...
  WHEN VN THEN EN
  [ELSE ED]
END

```sql

CASE cagtegory.name
  WHEN 'Children' THEN 'All Ages'
  WHEN 'Family' THEN 'All Ages'
  WHEN 'Sports' THEN 'All Ages'
  WHEN 'Animation' THEN 'All Ages'
  WHEN 'Horror' THEN 'Adult'
  WHEN 'Music' THEN 'Teens'
  WHEN 'Games' THEN 'Teens'
ELSE 'Other'
END

```

### Examples Of Case Expressions

#### Result Set Transformations

You may have run into a situation where you are performing aggregation over
a finite set of values, such as days of the week, but you want the result
set to contain a single row with one column per value instead of one row
per value.

```sql

SELECT monthname(rental_date) rental_month,
COUNT(*) num_rentals
FROM rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND '2005-08-01'
GROUP BY monthname(rental_date);

```

```sql

SELECT  
  SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'May' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) may_rentals
  SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'June' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) june_rentals
  SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'July' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) july_rentals
FROM rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND '2005-08-01';
```

#### Checking For Existence

Sometimes you will want to determine whether a relationship exists between two
entities without regard for the quantity. For example you might want to know
whether an actor has appeared in at least one G-rated film.
