## Transactions

A SQL transaction is a device for grouping together multiple SQL statements
such that either all or none of the statements succeed. (a property known as
  atomicity).

A tranaction looks like this

```sql

START TRANSACTION;

/* withdraw money from first account, making sure balance is sufficientl*/
UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 9988
AND avail_balance > 500;

/* deposit money into second account */
UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 9989;

IF <excatly one row was updated by the previous statement> THEN  
  /* everything worked, make thye changes permanent */
  COMMIT;
ELSE
  /* Something went wrong, undo all changes in this transaction */
  ROLLBACK;
END IF;
ELSE
  /* Insufficient funds, or error encountered during update */
  ROLLBACK;
END IF;

```


### Savepoints (like checkpoints for when transactions are not executed due to an interruption)

```sql

START TRANSACTION

UPDATE product
SET date_retired = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_id = 'XYZ';

SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;

UPDATE account
SET status = 'CLOSED', close_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
  last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;
COMMIT;
