# Filtering

## COndition Evaluation  

A where clause may contain one or more conditions, separated by the operators
and and or. If multiple conditions are separated only by the and operator, then
all the conditions must evaluate to true for the row to be included in the result
set.

```sql

WHERE first_name = 'STEVEN' AND create_date > '2006-01-01';
```

### Using the not Operator

```sql

WHERE NOT (first_name = 'STEVEN' OR last_name = 'YOUNG')
  AND create_date > '2006-01-01';
```

### BUilding A Condition

A condition is made up of one or more expressions combined with one or more
operators. An expression can be any of the following:

- A number
- A column in a table or view
- A string literal, such as 'Maple Street'
- A built-in function, such as concat ('Learning', ' ', 'SQL')
- A subquery
- A list of expressions, such as ('Boston', 'New York', 'Chicago')

THe operators used within conditions include:

  - Comparison operators, such as =, !=, <, >, <>, like, in, between
  - Arithmetic operators such as +, -, * and /

#### Condition Types

There are many different ways to filter out unwanted data, You can look for specific
values, sets of values, or ranges to include or exclude, or you can use various
pattern-searching techniques to look for partial matches when dealing with string
data.

##### Equality conditions

A large percentage of the filter conditinos that you write or come accrsoss will be
of teh form 'column=expression' as in :

title = 'River Outlaw'
fed_id = '111-11-111';
amount = 376.5
film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title= 'RIVER OUTLAW');

Conditions such as these are called equality conditions because they equate one
expression to another. The first three examples equate a column to a literal
(two strings and a number), and the fourth example equeate a column to the value
returned from a subquery.

```sql

SELECT c.email
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN rental r
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14';
```

##### Range Conditinos

Along with checking that an expression is equal to (or not equal to) another
expression, you can build conditions that check whether an express

```sql

SELECT customer_id, rental_date
FROM rental
WHERE rental_date <= '2005-06-16'
AND rental_date >= '2005-06-14';
```

###### The Between Operator

When you have both an upper and lower limit for your range, you may choose to
use a single condition that utilizes the between operator rather than using
two separate conditions, as in:

```sql

SELECT customer_id, rental_date
FROM rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-06-14' AND '2005-06-16';
```

==> String Ranges

```sql

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'FA' AND 'FRB';

```

### Membership conditions  

In some cases you will not be restricting an expression to a single value or
range of values but rather to a finite set of values. For example, you might
want to locate all films that have a rating or either 'G' or 'PG'

```sql

SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'G' or rating = 'PG';
```

A much better alternative

```sql

SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG')
```

==> Using Subqueries

Along with writing your own set of expressions, such as ('G', 'PG'), you can
use a subquery to generate a set for you on the fly. For example if you
can assume that any film whose title includes the string 'PET' would be safe
for family viewing, you could execute a subquery against the film table to retrieve
all ratings associated with these fils and then retrieve all films having only
these ratings

```sql

SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating IN (SELECT rating FROM film WHERE title LIK '%PET%');

```

==> Using not In

Sometimes you want to see whether a particular expression exists within a set
of expressions, and sometimes you want to see whether the expression does not
exist within the set. For these situations, you can use the not in operator

```sql

SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating NOT IN ('PG-13', 'R', 'NC-17');
```


#### Matching Conditions


```sql

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE left(last_name, 1)  = 'Q';
```

YOu can use wilcard characters to build search expressions,  

```sql

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE last_name LIKE '%Q%';
```

##### Using Wildcards

When searching for partial string matches, you might be interested in:

  - Strings begining/ending with a certain character
  - Strings beginning/ending with a substring
  - Strings containing a certain character anywhere within the string
  - Strings containig a substring anywhere within the string
  - Strings with a specific format, regardless of individual characters

You can build search expressions to identify these and many other partial string
matches by using the wildcard characters

##### Using Regular Expressions

```sql

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE last_name REGEXP '^[QY]';
```

#### Null: That Four-Letter Word

Null is the absence of a value

When working with null, you sould remember:

- An expression can be null, but it can never equal null
- Two nulls are never equal to each other

=> To test whether an expression is null, you need to use the is null operator
as in :

```sql

SELECT rental_id, customer_id
FROM rental
WHERE return_date IS NULL;

```
