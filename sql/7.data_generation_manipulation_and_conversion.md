## Data Generation, Manipulation and Conversion

### WOrking with String Data

When working with string data, you will be using one of the following character
data types:

CHAR:
  Holds fixed length, blank-padded strings, MysQL allows CHAR values up to 255
  characters in length, Oracle Database permits up to 2000 characters, and SQL
  Server allows up to 8000 characters

varchar:
  Holds variable-length strings. MyQL permits up to 65,535 characters in var char
  column, Oracle Database (via the varchar2 type) allows up to 4000 characters

text (MysQ or clob OracleDB):
  Holdds very large variable-length strings (generally referred to as documents in this context)
  Mysql has multiple text types (tinytext, text, mediumtext, and longtext) for documents
  up to 4GB in size.


```sql

CREATE TABLE string_tbl
(char_fild CHAR(30),
  vchar_fld VARCHAR(30),
  text_fld TEXT);
```

#### String generation

The simplest way to populate a character column is to enclose a string in quotes, as in
the following examples.

```sql

  INSERT INTO string_tbl (char_fld, vchar_fld, text_fld)
    VALUES ('This is a char data',
    'This is varchar data',
    'This is text data');

```

=> For the position of the string 'is' starting at the fifth character in the vchar_fld
column

```sql

SELECT LOCATE('is', vchar_fld, 5)
FROM string_tbl;
```

```sql

SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name,
' has been a customer since ', date(create_date)) cust_narrative
FROM customer;

```

### Working with Numeric Data

Unlike string data (and temporal data,), numeric data generation is quite straightforward
You can type a number, retrieve it from another column, or generte it via a calculation
All the usual arithmetic operators (+, -, * , /) are available for performing
calculations. and parentheses may be used to dictate precedence.

```sql

SELECT (37 * 59) * (78 - (8 * 6));
```

```sql

SELECT MOD(10, 4);
```

```sql

SELECT ROUND(72.49999), ROUND(72.5), ROUND(72.50001);
```
