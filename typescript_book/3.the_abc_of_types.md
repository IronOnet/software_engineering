## Any

any makes your value behave like it would in a regular JavaScript, and totally
prevents the typechecker from working its magic. When you allow any into your
code you're flying blind. Avoid any like fire.

On the rare occasion you need to use it, use it like this

```ts

let a : any = 777; // any
let b: any = ['danger']; // any
let c = a + b; // any
```

## Unknown

For the few cases where you have a value whose type you really don't know
ahead of time, done't use any, and instead reach for unknown. Like any
it represents any value, but Typescript won't let you use an unknown type
until you refine by checking what it is.  

```ts

let a: unknown = 30;
let b = a === 123; // boolean
let c = a + 10; // Error object is of type Unkown  
if(typeof a == 'number'){
  let d = a + 10;
}

```

## Number

number is the set of all numbers: integers, floats, positive, negatives,
Infinity, NaN and so on. Numbers can do additon, subtraction, modulo, multiplication
and other operations possible on numbers.

```ts

let a = 1234; // number
var b =  Infinity * 0.10; // number
const c = 5678; // 5678
let d = a < b; // boolean

let e: number = 100; // number
let f: 26.218 = 26.218 // 26.218
let g: 26.218 = 10; // Error TS2322: Type '10' is not assignable

let one_million = 1_000_000;
let twoMillion = 2_000_000;

```

## BigInt

BigInt lets you work with large integers without running into rounding errors
. While the number type  can only represent whole numbers up to 2**53,
bigint can represent numbers larger than that.

```ts

let f : bigint = 100n; // bigint
let g: 100n = 100n; // 100n
let h : bigint = 100; // Error TS2322: Type '100' is not assignable to type bigint


var message: string = "Hello World";
console.log(message);

```
